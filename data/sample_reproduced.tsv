But given the state of the world someone trained in the latter can be called on to practice on the former. Three Royal Australian Air Force mcdical officers, led by Squadron Leader Tracy Smart, arc currently on deployment in Rwanda as part of a 19-membcr air force team based in Kigali. And though Wing Commander James Ross, who advises on the pro vision of health services for the ser vice says ""They are there primarily to provide an aero-medical evacua tion service,"" their duties go further than that. Flying Officer Cath Rafter, a nurs ing officer who returned in February with the first RAAF contingent to serve for six months in Rwanda says, ""It was a great experience. It was just the sort of thing I joined up to do. I was very lucky. ""It was pretty awful at times,"" re collects the Brisbane-born Rafter, ""but we got to see and do a lot of mcdical and nursing things we'd never get to do here in Australia."" Indeed. The experience included living in a shot-up old military bar racks, without running water - that had to be carried in by the bucket, for washing and flushing toilets - or, ini tially, electricity. It also meant carrying a loaded rifle about with one, never going any where by oneself, and talcing infantry protection along whenever one went to the central Kigali hospital, partly ""resurrected"" by the Australians - and located across the road from the Rwandan Patriotic Army's barracks, a source of some angst and the occa sional confrontation. The RAAF provides a broad range of mcdical and dental services to its members. But as Flying Officer Raf ter's experiences attest, not one so specialised as to not be available for services well outside the realm of aviation medicine. Apart from its corps of 49 mcdical officers and just more than 40 den tists (of 46 positions - with another three or four resignations in the pipe line) the servicc maintains an estab lishment of 90 nursing officers like Rafter, recruited from the ranks of civilian registered nurses, or RNs, and 148 MEDASSTs - Medical As sistants, recruited from state enrolled nurses in the civilian sphere. Of the current RAAF contingent in Rwanda, apart from the three medical officers, there arc six nursing officers, all female, and 10 ME DASSTs - six of them, men. Cath Rafter was indeed lucky. She got her ticket to Kigali only a year after joining the service. It was the first overseas deployment of RAAF nursing staff since the Vietnam War. ""1 was working for a pathology company in Brisbane and I wanted to get back into acute nursing but I didn't relish the thought of going back into a public hospital system,"" she recalls. ""I'd done that!"" At high school she had toyed with the notion of joining the Air Force and she took up the option in Au gust, 1993. Her first few months were occupied with officer training at Point Cook. Then, after a two month stint at the RAAFs No.6 Hospital at Lavcrton, Victoria, she was posted on attachment to the Navy at HMAS Cerberus - where she was told she was going to Africa. The course of the men and women in the RAAFs health services is usu ally more predictably associated with aviation medicine, described by Ross as ""really a subspecies of occu pational medicine. ""And it's not just flying - people on the ground have occupational health problems, too. Occupational deaf ness is the number one problem, still."" And, paradoxically, fitness is an other. Like the other services, the Air Force requires high, physical stan dards in its members. Its medical officers and nursing staff treat a lot of shin splints! But there is a more specific conno tation to aviation medicine. 'We're asking people to work and operate in an environment which can be haz ardous to their health,"" says Squad ron Leader Mike O'Donoghue, of the RAAFs Institute of Aviation Medi cine at Edinbugh air base, near Ade laide. A University of NSW graduate, with three years' RAAF sponsorship, O'Donoghue put on Air Force uni form in 1987 and now is the IAM's chief instructor. One of his jobs is to teach air crews about the effects of hypoxia - lack of oxygen - in a cham ber \vhere altitudes of 25,000 feet can be simulated. Initial training in the effects of gravity forces also is conducted at the institute. Pilots are taught the risks entailed in operating their ejection seats, again with a simulator. Back and neck injury, and how to avoid it. has an important part in aviation mcdicinc. So docs disorientation, prevalent among air crcws flying through cloud. And specific illusions - the notion induccd by acceleration that an aircraft is gaining altitude when in fact it is in level flight. ""There arc cases where people have driven their aircraft into the ground as a result,"" he says. All told, the 1AM provides instruction each year to between 1300 and 1400 service personnel, in cluding medical officers from Army and Navy. At another level is acromedical evacuation. Flight Lieutenant Ross Wadsworth, at Richmond's No.3 Air Force Hospital is one of a team of 10 - the Operational Health Support and Training Flight, which includes three nursing officers, including him self, and two sergeant MEDASSTs - who train RAAF personnel in the subject. They also arc responsible for equipment movement for medical personnel, and sent a number of kits into Rwanda to back up the joint Army/Air Force effort there. Wing Commander Tony Dawson has spent 17 years in the Air Force as a dental officer. ""We almost always have a shortage bccausc it's often seen as a good career move to spend a short time in the services after graduating from dental school."". ""We practicc the full range of den tal practice,"" he says. ""One of the big attractions for me when I joined was 1 could provide an ideal treatment for the patient, rather than having to compromise bccausc the patient might not be able to afford the best. In the Air Force, because the cost to the patient is not a consideration we can provide ideal treatment plans."" Dawson admits he probably has put clinical dentistry behind him: there are only three Wing Com mander dentists in the RAAF, and they all are engaged in staff work. Initially he intended, like most, to stay on only for four years. ""In that time, 1 found I enjoyed the life. It's a lifestyle thing. I'd prob ably make more money outside. ""But you don't spend your life in clinical dentistry. There is manage ment, there is staff development - all the things you'd do in general prac tice but its more formalised in the Air Force and we get formal training, which is something you don't nor mally get in private practicc."""

Sheahan front-runner for Attorney-General SYDNEY: Three candidates have emerged for appointment as NSW At torney-General. They are the Minister for Planning and Environment Minister, Mr Sheahan, the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, Mr Mulock, and former Attorney-General Mr Walker. A shuffling of the Cabinet by the Premier, Mr Wran, is considered cer tain following the death of the At torney-General, Mr Landa, on Satur day afternoon (reported in The Can berra Times yesterday). Mr Sheahan is considered the front runner for appointment. Mr Walker's previous time in the job has left him luke-warm about it, and Mr Mulock is very much an outsider. He is in the middle of the protracted doctors' dis pute and it would be unlikely he would be moved. Also, he and Mr Wran had some disagreement when Mr Mulock was Minister for Justice. Mr Sheahan, the Member for Bur rinjuck which borders the ACT, would become a Cabinet Minister and get back some of the prestige he lost in his unsuccessful bid for Deputy Premier earlier this year. There is also the problem of filling Mr Landa's vacancy in the Cabinet, with the prospect of factional bitter ness. Mr Landa belonged to no faction and owed much of his' success in making his way up Cabinet to Mr Wran's patronage. Therefore, it will be difficult for any of the factions to lay claim to the vacancy by dint of in heritance. The left will claim the position for Mr Gabb, the Member for Earlwood, by virtue of the left's under-represen tation in Cabinet and because of a gentlemen's agreement with the right. The strongest tip, though, appears to be the Member for Maroubra and chairman of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Mr Carr, who has very strong support from the right wing and is widely respected by all factions. However, he has only been in Parliament since October last year and this may count against him. Mr Wran is not expected to make decisions on his Cabinet moves for some time. He will act as Attorney General himself for the time being. A private funeral service will be held in Sydney today for Mr Landa, and a private burial will follow. In a tribute to Mr Landa, who died of a heart attack while playing tennis at the home of friends in Sydney's exclusive eastern suburb of Vaucluse, Mr Wran described him as a trailblazer for environmental and planning issues. He had had the intelligence and capability to be a future Premier. ""Not only NSW but the whole of Australia is in debt to him because of his efforts in environmental matters,"" Mr Wran said. ""I will miss him on a political and personal level."" The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said, ""He was a young man who had already achieved much in the servicc of his party and the community. ""The best of his career was still before him."" The NSW Leader of the Opposition, Mr Greiner, said he had been shocked by the death. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, said Mr Landa had had a fine legal mind and the capacity to apply it in a very practical way to solve problems in administration and the law. The Federal Attorney-General, Sen ator Evans, said Mr Landa had been a good friend and colleague who had had an enormous store of energy, in telligence and good humour. Mr Landa is survived by his wife Annika, and one daughter, Sophie. He had been a member of the NSW Parliament since 1973 and had made a transition from the Legislative Council to the Legislative Assembly last year. He represented the electorate of Peats, near Gosford on the Central Coast. He was born in Sydney in May, 1941, and attended Sydney Boys' High School before studying law at Sydney University. He began practising as a solicitor in 1964, was admitted to the bar in 1975, and was made a Queen's Counsel within the last month. During his time in Parliament, he held the portfolios of Industrial Rela tions, Planning and the Environment, Education, Consumer Affairs, Energy, Natural Resources and Attorney General. He was a very keen tennis player and regularly attended Wimbledon. He began his political career as a teenager when he joined the NSW Labor Party. When the Wran Government swept to power in 1976, Mr Landa was made Minister for Planning and Environ ment and was one of the youngest ministers in NSW political history. He had been Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council since 1976. Recently, Mr Landa was embroiled in controversy over the introduction of the Local Courts Act for NSW. The Act was to give magistrates independent status, and would allow five magistrates to be moved to other jobs in the public service. The row centred around whether the Chief Magistrate, Mr Clarrie Briese, would be reappointed as Chief Magis trate in view of his involvement in recent State'and federal inquiries into the judiciary. Mr Landa had often been rumoured to be a possible successor for Mr Wran and also had been the subject of recent rumours that he might resign from politics to take a diplomatic post."

It also becomes more an anecdotal and laughter-laden exchange because of the convoluted nature of their rela tionships and because the three have the natural exuberance of their Italian ori gins. , The two older men are married to the sisters of Mr Casadei and there are, among the families, aunts who are younger than their nephews, or perhaps it is the other way round. Mr Beniamini came to Australia in 1970 and followed his trade as a cocktail barman and drink waiter in various Canberra venues, such as the Yowani Country Club and the Parkroyal. He opened Juliana's and also presided over the Washington Bar at the Canberra Rex for eight years. It was during that time that he tried to persuade other members of the family ' that they should establish the city's first Italian restaurant, prompted by inquiries from international visitors to the hotel: ""There were no Italian restaurants in Canberra then. None"". He reflects on how many have come along in the 12 years since. He had given up on the idea when, not so long ago, his wife drew his attention to an advertisement offering the sublease of the bistro at the Deakin Inn. She ""forced"" him to make inquiries and, when he saw the sun streaming into the room, his enthusiasm revived. He man aged to transfer his enthusiasm to his relatives. Mr Casadei, who migrated from Rome in 1971, is the youngest of the three, and also worked in the bar trade, managing the bar at the Italo-Australian Club at 21 ""but then finding myself a comfortable job in the Public Service"". He took leave while the restaurant was established, arid has since resigned to join his brothers-in-law as a fully in volved partner. Which brings us, ultimately, to Mr Bernardini. Now 38, trim, with a big, drooping moustache which fails to smother the laughs or hide the grin, he was born and educated in Rome. He emerged from .a tertiary college with a diploma in chemical research. He worked for the Italian Defence Depart ment but smilingly turns away questions on the actual field. He had grown up in the Trastevere region ""in the old part of Rome"" where his papa had a trattoria ""about five minutes from their home"". His mama was the chef and the young Alvaro and his brother were around the kitchen from infancy and all through their school years. Without formal training, he none the less acquired a thorough grounding in marketing and cooking of traditional regional and other Italian dishes, plus absorbing Mama's insistence on quality, freshness. He enjoys cooking, but when he came to Australia in 1972 avoided ""the kit chen"", first because he wanted to, later because he and his wife, Lucia, had young children, Silvio, now 11, Stefano, eight, and Francesca, live. He worked as a truck driver, bus driver, security guard and public servant in welfare, ""but finally gave in and went to cook at the Italo-Australian Club"". He had no idea that he would relatively quickly be cooking in his own kitchen, his own restaurant. The brothers-in-law saw the same potential in the room as Mr Bcniamini and the family pitched in to such odd jobs as making new curtains, cleaning, bagging and painting walls, and adapting the small kitchcn as best they could. The success of the venture has prompted the lease of an expanded area, which will enable enlargement and re modelling of the kitchcn (and give it a window to the outside of the building), while other developments will enable improvement to the lavatories. The three men run the place themselves with help from wives and children as neces sary, although some of the younger people have also found ""comfortable"" places in the Public Service. They admit to heated discussion, even argument, but say that it is a matter of temperament and of no resentment. The impression is that it really is all good fun. Whatever is possible is prepared in the Tivoli kitchen, but what cannot be done is supplemented by the best quality available. Their main fear at present is that the fluctuating dollar might force compromises, in coffee and imported pasta for instance. Mr Bernardini is delighted to have found, at last, an Italian butcher in Canberra who ""makes traditional sausages the way I like them: veal, pork, Chef Alvaro Bernardini in the kitchen of the Tivoli Restaurant, Deakin Inn. spicy, peppery. We cannot get enough of them. As soon as we put them on, everyone wants them."" But for the present they are delighted that more and more people are discover ing the restaurant, that many of them are returning often enough to become ""regu lars"", and that the possibilities for ex pansion and improvement are opening, although they do not want to get too big, or become involved in big functions or outside catering. They quite plainly are happy to remain restaurateurs. A discussion develops when he gives the quantities for his recipe; ""but I love pasta"", he says. The recipe is ""for two big eaters"". Spaghetti USatriciana 150g unsmoked bacon cut in strips 50g finely choppcd onion olive oil 400g spaghetti SOOg tin peeled tomatoes touch hot chilli powder Prepare spaghetti in usual way, al dentc.

Training 'troops' to tackle a killer SITTING below a Doctors Against Nu clear War poster, Dr Bruce Robinson sounds uncharacteristically like a gen eral planning Armageddon. Describing his medical team's battle against WA's asbestos disease epidemic, he talks of shock troops, commandos and mo bilising armies of killer cells, and sketches tiny tanks to illustrate how the body's de fences rally to fight cancer. The senior lecturer in medicine at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre in Perth heads a six-strong research team at war with the worst of the asbestos diseases - meso thelioma - which normally kills its victims within nine months of diagnosis. Big tumours vanished from two patients after the team used new techniques to strengthen their natural defence systems to the point where they overwhelmed the can cer. Both patients had advanced mesothelio ma, and their cancerous tissue has now virtually disappeared. But the doctors say it is loo early to talk of their treatment being a cure because 11 other patients involved in the clinical trial of the naturally occurring protein, interfer on, failed to respond to the treatment. Still the limited success means a lot to doctors who until now have been dealing with a painful disease that was invariably fatal. ""The results arc very encouraging,"" Dr Robinson said. ""It gives us and the patients the hope that some time in the future we might find an effective therapy."" ? At least one:of the two patients who responded would be dead by now'without the treatment. The traditional approach to treating can cels to 4estroy.4i,eitKer;Y/Uh a.cell,poison, New immunotherapy techniques attack the cancer from outside by boosting the killer cells - while hlootLiCell&ealleddym-, fchocytes - wWehta^HWe""boti^hbrmar,< defences. . - The body's defence mechanism operates similarly to a military chief of a country that has been invaded, Dr Robinson says. ""It has scouts which decide if the new arrival is a foreigner or one of your own blokes,"" he said. If the scouts identify cancer, an army of killer cells that patrol the body is mobilised and the call goes out to the body's ""bomb factory"" to make more weapons. And contrary to the widely held belief that cancer is generally incurable, it is likely that the body's natural defences often over whelm cancers without the ""victims"" even knowing they had been threatened by them. The team's technique is to boost the body's natural defences, the billions of killer cells that move constantly on patrol through the body. When these killer cells identify cancer cells they stick on to them and fire a chemi cal dart into them. , ""The whole idea of this system is to en hance the ability of these cells to move from cell to cell and lull the cancer,"" Dr Robinson said. Senior research officer Dr Linda Manning cultures malignant human mesothelioma cells at the QEII centre. ""We turn them on like the army turns regular soldiers into commandos. ""We try to beef up those defences - turn them into very effective killers."" One technique is to take blood from the patient and remove killer cells from it. These are treated with interleukin-2 (1L-2) - which, like interferon, is a protein produced in the body to fight viruses - in a laboratory for four days, which causcs them to become very active and multiply rapidly. This ""shock force"" of killer cells is then injected back into the patient's bloodstream with more IL-2. IL-2 has cured some cancer patients in United States studies, particularly those with kidney cancer and melanoma. ""But they did not cure everyone with those illnesses,"" Dr Robinson said. Interferon acts similarly but as well as toughening up the killer cells it also attacks the cancer directly. Its main limiting factor is flu-like side cffects and the research team is looking for ways to reduce them. It appears the body aches and tempera tures associated with a dose of flu may be caused by naturally-occurring interferon re leased by the body to'fight a virus. The other modern approach is to find out why cells become cancerous. A cancer cell grows rapidly and uncon trolled because it ""short-circuits"" and either makes growth factors to stimulate itself or is fooled into thinking it has received a growth signal. Scientists look into the cell to find the defects in the cancer genes (oncogenes) that . cause it to grow too fast. As they find these they try to develop ways to switch off the out-of-control genes. Mesothelioma is one of the most aggres sive cancers and is very resistant to drugs and surgery. It occurs when a spear-like asbestos fibre penetrates a'cell in the mesothelium - the lining that.encases the lungs - and over 30 ? yearssor.""morc 'stimulates jchangesc which . turn it into a cancer cell. * Asbestos fibres are very sharp and only four. or.five microns,long, (a .micron is,a d .millior(thgfamet;e),!-^:r "" 1 Probably everyone in Perth has some fibres in their lungs, Dr Robinson says. In some eases one or more fibres will get through to the lining and cause mesothelio ma. The tumour grows quickly and in the advanced stages encases the lung and often the heart. The Perth research indicates asbes""3s may also in some way paralyse killer cells. Several factors make WA a logical re search base in the war against cancer gener ally. Mesothelioma is one of the few cancers whose cause scientists are certain about. It is not known, for example, which of about 200 components of cigarette smoke causes lung cancer. Scientists also know who has been ex posed to asbestos in WA and can study people in the at-risk group who have not yet developed cancer. The team has already discovered that a significant proportion of those exposed in this way have weakened anti-cancer de fences that may make them more suscepti ble to mesothelioma. THE DOCTORS take killer cells from the blood and test them in the labora tory to measure how active they are. Very low killer-cell activity in some of those tested suggests the person's anti cancer defence mechanism has been sup pressed. If some of them later develop cancer the ' researchers: can'slobk; for common' factors that made them vulnerable.

The Armistice in Syria. (BY HECTOR MNNINQ.) There Is a wonderful Impression of Armis- tice Day In London In ""Peter Jackson, Cigar Merchant."" On that occasion the celebrated English reserve (which is a complete myth) apparently was broken down, and the crowd went mad In Trafalgar Square. Anyone who | has ever seen an English crowd In action will know that It Is far from being reserved. You have to come to Australia to know how undemonstrative a crowd can be. English- men as individuals may be reserved. But in a crowd they have a tradition of demonstra tlveness to which they live up. At a theatre, watching the Lord Mayor's show, at a foot- ball match, when the King drives down the Mall, they Infect each other like anything, and fairly embarrass an Australian by their effusiveness. To be demonstrative in a crowd Is something that is ""done"" in England. And It is done with thoroughness. But by all accounts the place to have been In on Armistice Day was Paris-If unleashed enthusiasm was what you were after. The French, whose normal state is one of ebulli- tion-whether at the tea table or at the race- course-were themselves with a vengeance on Armistice Day, we are told. And as for Armistice Night in Paris, it will never be for- gotten, even by the French. But as for those Britishers who saw it-my word! ENTIRE NONCHALANCE. The armistice overtook us In bivouac out- side Horns, near Aleppo. That was a bleak setting. If Australians as a race are unde- monstrative, the Light Horsemen were so In excelsls. The Light Horse were by tempera- ment a silent lot, with all the self-contained qualities of the Australian bushman. But after the devastating desert campaign of Sinai and the gruelling, galloping pursuit of the Turkish army from Jerusalem, the Light Horse were as weary, cynical, laconic, sar- donic, hard-bitten, hatchet-faced a race as the Redskins of America ever produced, which Is saying a great deal. They were In no mood for an hilarious outburst over anything-even over news of an armistice. When the first rumours of the armistice came through, they were greeted with a derisive and twisted humour. The men were so far from caring whether the war was actually at an end that their Instinct was to treat the rumours as mere ""furphies."" They were completely worn out, and-in the language of the dairying dis- tricts-didn't care whether the cow calved or broke her neck. When, a few hours later, the rumour of an armistice was officially con- firmed and announced, they reacted to it with entire nonchalance. The people at home in Australia, and Aus- tralians who served in Prance, have no con- ception of the devastating monotony of the campaigns of Sinai, Palestine, and the Jordan Valley, and of their effect on the men who stuck them. France had the more intense and ceaseless fighting; Palestine the more In- tense discomfort. France offered* endless variety in the country and the people of the war zone; the monotony of Palestine was hideous. The sand, the dust, the uninspiring Bedouin population, the dysentery, the mala- ria, the Inferior and unvarying food-the whole Inevitable sameness-of the desert campaigns cancelled all the advantages of the compara- tive ""safety"" of the war in the Middle East. The Light Horsemen would willingly have ex- changed the bloodlessness and the bleakness of their lot for the superior bloodiness and variety of the Infantrymen's. At least, they thought they would. A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT, But the fact remains that, when the armtistlce did come, It found the infantrymen with a far greater capacity to rise to It than the llghthorsemen. This was, of course, in great measure due to the differences in their environment. The Diggers in France were in the heart of a thickly-settled country, In- habited by friendly and vivacious people, who reacted to the armistice with great and spon- taneous rejoicing. The armistice found the Bill-Jims of Palestine In the heart of a barren countryside, and surrounded by Bedouins and Hedjaz troops, who showed as much en- thusiasm over the armistice as might have been expected from people as to whom you were always in doubt, during the campaign, whether they were fighting with you or with the Turks. When, to the native sombreness of the Australian bushman, you add his ex- perience of a boring campaign and the de- pressing companionship of a lot of wooden faced Bedouins, is it likely that these ingre- dients, together will give a very spontaneous reaction even to an armistice? No-and they did not give it. To damp down enthusiasm a little further, a spell of rain Immediately preceded the news of the armistice in Syria. Does the reader know what it is like sleeping under bivouac sheets In wet weather? In the phrase of America, ""Can you beat it?"" No, sir. Does the reader know what it Is like mucking around horse lines in the rain? But, above all, does the reader-unless he has been there know how it can rain in Syria in November? His answer to these questions will be the measure of his comprehension of the kind of ""armistice"" we had outside Horns. The emotion that stirred most of us was a futile desire to be back in Cairo for the occa- sion. Most of us actually sketched out the line of attack we would have taken In Cairo. Some were for a night in the bazaars, some for a gharry to the Pyramids, some for a session at the Turf Club, some for a Joumey to Rod el Faraq, up the Nile, some for a foregathering at the nurses' quarters of the -th A.O.H. (very popular this suggestion), some for a night at Hellopolis. But, however diverse the suggestions, all agreed on two things, dinner in Shepbeard's grill room and a rendezvous in the great hall at Shepheard's at midnight. And by all accounts of what happened In Shepheard's Hall that midnight the common instinct on this point was sound. But, as it turned out, all we actually did do was to crouch in our ""biwies,"" talk about Cairo, take a drink out of our enamel mugs, and turn In. It was not till about a week later that we realised the full significance of the fact that that night, for the first time in four years, not a shot was being fired in Europe. _"	"bloodlessness and the bleakness of their lot for the superior bloodiness and variety of the Infantrymen's .

THE NEAVES f II A. M LET Perhaps the most generally acceptable gift' I book for the coming season will bo AAr. G. Sim-1 , monds' ""Hamlet"" (Ilodder and Stoughton, through Angus and Robertson). This is one of a series of illustrated editions of Shakes- peare, planned on a large scale, and furnished i with colour drawings by the best, and, in-1 | eidPtitnlly, the most modern artists available. | ' There has not been a volume that has boon a conspicuous failure, and there have been ' scA'eral that havo been a conspicuous success. ' ¡Among the lattor must bo classed ""Hamlet,""; though the drawing is rather too scholarly, or perhaps wo should say too carefully avoiding of tho obvious (o please everyone at the first' blush. Mr. Simmonds' guiding passion has been to steer clear of counterfeit present- ment made too familiar by stage setting. Ills next strongest motive has been fidelity to his- toric detail, so that, tor instance, we get a, picture of Elsinore like nothing' that was ever on tho land or sea of stage production; | ¡ but something that probably comes astonish-j j ingly near the real thing. The average I render's first impression, theroforo, will be I one of surprise, possibly of un;Ieasant sur I priso. In that ho will be wrong. Mr. Slm monds had a very difficult task. So many of the principal scenes of the play have boen illustrated by great painters, and it was before all things needful to avoid the appear auco of copying their work. At the same time, the artist has abundant spirit and imagination, and though ho does not, in our opinion, always take the full advantage of his opportunity, his drawing Is always striking, and except in lils treatment .of the Ophelia motif, his colouring is always good-thcrq, ho falls a victim to the' fatal seduction of white and green. On the whole, however, ho has prcducud a notable , series of illustrations, and the book as It stands may b» r-rdlally commended, moro particularly to the more discriminating. For, choice wo should havo trusted tho work to Brangwyn or Dulac, but that, of course, is] wholly a matter of personal opinion. Tho general form of tho sumptuous volumo follows that of the earlier members of tho series, and Sir Arthur Quillcr-Couch writes the.usual story f of tho play. Ilarrap and Co. forward several gift books ¡ for the Christmas season. As most people! know, this firm make a special .feature of calorlng for young folk, and anything that, they «publish Is likely to be acceptable. "".Hero Myths and Legends of tho British Race,"" by, M. S. Ehbutt, is uniform with similar vol- umes of tho legends of Greece and Romo anil i the old Norso legends, rotold for boys and girls and attractively Illustrated, in this caso! by Bacon, Byam Shaw, and others. Such le- gends form tho background of literature, .and too much cannot bo said or tho plan of familiarising young people with Hiern. Tho present selection, for lnstdnco, includes tho story of Eleno, of Havololt the Dnno, of Ro lnnd, of Gnmolyn, of King Horn, of Robin Hood, of Hereward the Wake, and others. Groat discretion has been shown' by tho au- thor in his proso style, neither ovor-bold lu its.romanticism üor BO'cold and raodorn that tho old glamour is lost.

It Is specially suited as a gift book for young boya in tho lovvor forms of classical schools.- The treatment' Is' quite rnodcrn, and tho nuthqr. has brpught to boar a real knowledge of his subject; but tho book is not a moro story book, and is consequently not tho thing for vory young children. ""Tho High Deeds of Finn"" com- pares nearest, perhnps, with ""The Hound of Ulster,"" and similar col- lections of Celtic matorlal. It is a re-reading of several barbaric roman- eos of ancient Iroland by T. ""AV. Rolleston and tho veteran Stopford Brooke contribute»! au Introduction; of course, not iutonded for, children. Indeed, thero is a great deal of solid Celtic scholarship behind tho author| himself, and the collection, besides proving entertaining to tho young, Is by no means to bo despised by tho serious student of onrly literature, xvho cannot bo expected to know tho original dialects of all tho old romances.

The result is that the present stories come from nil Imaginable sources, and most of tliom ought to bo pretty fresh to young renders, though we doubt If mauy older heads will be ablo to traco all of them to their source. The most striking tendency of recent years lins been to rnnsack the older lllorn turo of all lands, and recast It in rcadablo form; and TV hilo this in Itself goes far to make literature Intolllgiblo and attractive, it may in a few cases go further, and make a scholar. Few people pay enough nttontion to the formative factors that go to tho making of their children's minds, and fewer still realiso that more is done in that way out of school thnn in It.

Now that eggs havo dropped to 7d per dozen thoi are mauy inquiries from householders as to the mo siinplo methods of preserving small quantities uni tho scarce and dear season. Tho process of -cgf preserving has of Into years developed to an extol worthy tho importance it warrants. Cold storage the most perfect system, but this form of prcscrvii] Ls not practicable for small quantities for homo coi sumption, particularly in way-back places. What over system bo adopted it is important that tho egf bc quite now laid, and if uufcrtile they w*ill keep sti better. Tho soluble glrlss proccis is considered tl best, tho mode of using it is us follows :-To one pai of silicato of soda add 10 parts of water which hu been previously boiled ; place tho eggs iii casks, koro sene tins, or other vessels ; pour the solution over th eggs until they are covered a few inches ; placo a li on tho vessel to keep out thc dust, i&c. ; put in a cot place ; nnd the eggs can bo taken out perfectly ires ¿ix or eight months hence. Another old, simple, and effective preservative i thc well-known lime-water system. This process i most favoured in tho old country, and to a limite extent hero. One pint of fresh lime is lidded lo cac gallon of previously boiled water ; when cold this i poured over tho eggs until they arc completely itu jincrsod. Tho results from this system will bo foum I satisfactory. Another system is simplicity itself. Th ! eggs nre to bo packed III dry salt, a layer ol' salt nm another of eggs, until tho vessel is nearly full. Thei on top a thick layer of salt ; cover with a lid, am ¡ keep in a cool, dry pince until required. ' Greasing the eggs is a method adopted largely ii France. Tliis is performed by rubbing butter or oi between tho hands, and smearing tho egg with tho gTcnso. Theso greased eggs ur better if stored in a basket in a dn lillico. They must not bo closed up in boxes or i j damp situation, or they may turn mouldy. Any o the above methods is effective, and, provided tin eggs are fresh when stored, mid kept in a cool place, there need be no fear of tho results. Tho fashionable London "" Graphic "" is not a pape: to which fanciers turn for poultry news or notes still, a late issuo is a departure from tho orthodox two distinctly separate notices being given to tbi¡ subject. Tho first is a coloured supplement entitlcr ""A Popular Sport ""-cocking in thc curly dnys o tho century-drawn hy Mr. Small, who gives a reid istie picture of the cockpit with the assemblage ol dukes, lords, jockeys, gamblers, and other constitu- ents found in sporting life in thc middle of thc eighteenth century. The second and following re- ference is moro modem :-*' An interesting discus- sion lias anson as to whether thc prizes given by ngri cultural and other societies really help poultry-breed- ing. Tho offhand answer would be, ' Of course ; every prize is something to the good ; ' but tho prac- tical mau leads oil' with on awkward rejoinder, ' Show tests ure no tests of laying, und all tests winch ignore laying are misleading.' Tho value of fowds for murket purposes is another point in question. It is counted us important by the Bath uud West of Kngland, hut is ignored by tho lloyal. Hero wo may say, without much diffidence, that thc latter ure to bc exhorted to imitato tho enterprise of tho Westoni society. The societies,, when attacked by experts, msy fairly rejoin that fashion plays an absurd part in poultry-breeding. Brahmas and Cochins ure no longer tho vogue they onco were, the once famous ' Cuckoo Dorking ' is almost extinct, and Luugshnns are olit of favour. Who shall decide between fashion and utility in these and similar cases 'i "" Tho usc of incubator» is spreading. They aro now mode in all sizes, beginners preferring tho mnullcr sizes. As a 100-egg incubator will hatch us many cliickciiB us eight or 10 hens, and as the clucks can bo kept in a small space together under ono brooder, thcro is no more («re required than in attending to a largo number of broody hens. As nil the chicks can bo hatched at onco they consequently reach the mar- ket in one lot, and ure ii ni i orin in size. The best timo to leam with an incubator is in tho summer, when eggs ure cheap, as tho coBt ol' running the brooder is also then low. It is not difficult to ope- rate nu incubator, but there is something to leam ; hence tho incubator and brooder should be operated as a trial before attempting to hatch for the market. The question of fcrtde eggs with the breeder is ono of great importance. To havo thc hens lay, and to have them lay eggs that will bring out good healthy chicks, arc two points that ure not always associated. Proper mating is very important, but this does not ensure eggs I hat will give satisfactory results ¡proper feeding und plenty of exercise are of equal mipor ? tunee. Only by experience can knowledge bo gamed on these important points. In having hens loy well, the main thing to bo observed is thc maintenance of natural conditions or surroundings us much as possible. It is the nature of thu light and medium sized breeds to scratch ¡md be on the move, and it is also their nature to loy when they ari; surrounded by those thiugs which tend to their comfort. When such con- ditions exist it. is in keeping with nature for hens to bo healthy, and to lay eggs that will produce vigorous chicks. It is not good policy lo force tho breeding stock. More oirgs may lie bad perhaps by feeding highly on stimulating food, but it is doubtful whether us many eggs would hatch and chickens reared than if fed naturally. Success and failure with poultry depend upon the poultryinun himself. There ara good opportunities with poultry, und many ways of saving sonic of the money by judicious arrangements and close attention in the keeping of fowls ; but for a beginner to sup- pose that hccuti.se he is provided with a certain amount of money, and cnn''secure a likely-looking lillico for business, success is carinia, is a mistuku that may result in disappointment. Although ut first matters may sccin easy, the undertaking may sooner or later oin! in very sad awakening to the.rcnlity oí tho dead loss. Hut provided the business could bei made un adjunct to something elsu that does pay, ¡then, with acquired knowledge and unremitting attention to tho sniiille.it details, it may bu ninde to add very materially to tho annual receipts, and later j on may'bo made un exclusive business. Mistakes ure often made in attempting too much at first by keep ' ing too unary kinds ; it is thorciorc advisable to do chlo which of the breeds will ba best in the situation selected, lind keep and breed nothing else. It a beginning is mnde with a few, aud increased cvory y-ear, they eau he made to nay. Wini au clouient of uncertainly there is about a setting ot egg» ; every egg may bo fertilised, yet lt given to a certain hen niayjiot hatch at all. Some hens are not good "" incubators."" They may sit well, und yet tho eggs will nol hatch. Another hen may bring tlic chicks out, hut may crush several of thom in the nest, or may break some of the eggs before the time for Ihcin to hatch. Some hens will hatch evory egg and rear every chick, wlnto with other settings but a few chickens will hatch. Ono may feel well satisfied with au nvcragc throughout the season of 50 to 75 ncr ccut. hatch from all the eggs set."	"bo gamed on these important points .

Followers of Common wealth-statc relations would be well aware of the intense politics surrounding new federalism in the past tew weeks. Many com mentators heralded the collapse of new federalism in mid-October, when the state and territory leaders determined to boycott the Perth Spe cial Premiers' Conference. The wheels have not fallen ofT new federalism. It is still on the road, despite conflict over who is driving the process and at what speed. It would appear that the Prime Minis ter, Bob Hawke, still has the steering wheel and that the Premiers and Chief Ministers are back on board. There are three major reasons why new federalism stalled. First was the leaking by a senior Northern Territory bureaucrat to the Leader of the Federal Opposition, John Hew son, of a paper on reform of financial relations. Second there was reborn backbencher Paul Kcating's asser tion that the Commonwealth was poised to deliver income-tax powers to the states. The third reason was the determination of hardline states' rights exponents to squeeze better financial and administrative ar rangements out of the Common wealth. The most bizarre and destructive gymnastics in that re spect were performed by NSW and Queensland bureaucrats. Each of these factors contributed to the premiers pulling the plug on the Perth conference. That meeting was replaced with a state/territory only meeting in Adelaide. The leak from the Northern Terri tory to Dr Hewson enabled him to score some easy points from Mr Hawke during Question Time. He tried to get Mr Hawke to commit himself to revenue and/or tax-shar ing arrangements for the states. Mr Hawke did not fall for it, but was certainly shocked that Dr Hewson had such accurate intelligence on the substance of Commonwealth-state deliberations. The real political fall-out was else where. The NSW Libera! Premier, Nick Greiner, panicked that the leak to Dr Hewson would be laid at his doorstep. A swift all-state investiga tion revealed the source as a senior NT bureaucrat. The Federal Treasury (mostly un der Mr Keating's stewardship) has been starving state/territory finances for several years. There is a close correlation between the amount of federal Budget surpluses (proudly trumpeted by Mr Keating in the late 1980s) and the decrease in financial assistance grants to the states during the same period. The financial stress on the states has fuelled the legiti mate scramble for additional and secure funding. It was the states who put reform of financial relations on the new federalism agenda. Mr Keating seems to have excel lent sources remaining in the Trea sury on developments in this regard. Treasury cares a great deal about splintering federal income-tax ar rangements. It has no particular re spect for current tied-grant mechanisms. Not surprisingly, these are the views that Mr Keating has articulated, with most of his ire di rected at proposals for a state in come tax. Mr Keating told the National Press Club in late October that uone of the gravest dangers we face as a nation today is the dismembering of the national government which would inevitably follow from sur rendering revenue and other nation al responsibilities to the states"". IN fact, such an apocalyptic shift in Commonwealth-state rela tions has never been on the real fed eral agenda. It is true that the merits of such a shift have been canvassed in confidential reports prepared by Commonwealth and state bureau crats. However, this must be consid ered in the context that such analysis was part of a process whereby all options were examined. There is no evidence the federal Cabinet felt in clined to endorse the more radical scenario painted by Mr Keating. Mr Keating appears to have been well briefed on several options contained in the report of the work ing party on tax powers. One set of options included allowing the states to impose a flat-rate tax, introduce their own tax scale or a surcharge on Commonwealth tax payable. The second set of options in the report considered handing over Commonwealth excise powers on al cohol, tobacco and petrol to the states. Each of these options was proposed to reduce vertical fiscal imbalance (whereby the Common wealth raises most of revenue but the states conduct most of expendi ture). What Mr Keating failed to ac knowledge was that the reallocation of income-tax powers was never likely to get federal Cabinet endorse ment. The report of the working par ty on tax powers was highly qualified in its analysis. Such a proposal, it said, would ""have far-reaching ef fects on the community and, while that is no reason for avoiding change, it does argue for very careful consideration"". It continued that such adjustments would ""have ma jor effects for decades to come"". On the issue of income-tax powers for the states, the report argues, ""For efficiency and compliance reasons, it would seem desirable that the states adopt the Commonwealth tax base and utilise centralised collection were this option to be pursued"". These matters were well aired in the media in early October before an October 4 federal Caucus seminar Paul Keating: ire directed at state-income-tax proposals. on new federalism. There is no doubt that the Keating fear position was aimed at the hearts (and votes) of Caucus members troubled over the new federalism process. Howev er, Mr Hawke short-circuited this seduction by blandly advising the Caucus seminar that there would be no major transfer of taxing powers to the states (which still implicitly left room for manoeuvre). While Mr Keating was momen tarily disarmed, the Hawke stance angered some premiers. The South Australian Premier, John Bannon, and Mr Greiner met Mr Hawke at The Lodge on Friday, October 8. They presented him with a final state/territory position paper en titles A Proposal for Reducing Verti cal Fiscal Imbalance. The position paper had been modified from earli er drafts to give the Commonwealth the control of determining a share of income-tax revenue to be earmarked for the states, making them ""perma nent and responsible partners in the nation's economic management"". The states regarded such control as meaning that the share should not be regarded as a state income tax per se. Mr Bannon and Mr Greiner ar gued that the states must have a broad tax base, which would grow with the economy, and also that they rejected the transfer of excise pow ers. They advised the Prime Minis ter that the states would refuse to Howe insists reform will be achieved budge on adjustments to roles and responsibilities arising from the functional reviews of policy areas until the tax issue was resolved. Mr Hawke was reported to have been polite but firm with the pre miers, reaffirming the commitment he had given to the Caucus seminar. That evening a copy of the state proposal was acquired by Mr Keating. It confirmed the concerns he had aired. He prepared an incis ive rebuttal of the state position, which was circulated to Cabinet members on the Sunday and to Cau cus members on the Monday. The problem for Paul Keating was that it was a non-issue. Cabinet had little difficulty consigning the state proposal to the waste-paper basket in the early hours of Monday, No vember 11. It was, however, agreed by Cabinet that the Prime Minister would have the task of advising the states in cordial terms that their bid was unlikely, but was receiving fur ther analysis. The forum for this ex change was to have been the Perth Special Premiers' Conference. History now records that the Min ister for the Environment (and a key Keating supporter), Ros Kelly, blurt ed out the Cabinet decision to the national media at her first opportu nity the next day. Mr Hawke was forced to make a full statement to The states' problems must be addressed Parliament that afternoon in a hope less attempt to avoid an aggressive response by the states. The states' response was as pre dictable as it was swift; the premiers cancelled the Perth confcrencc that evening. Mr Hawke tried once more during a 50-minute phone hook-up on Tuesday, November 12, to get the states back into the special premiers' conference. The premiers felt that Mr Hawke had been bound by feder al Cabinet and Caucus to a non-ne gotiable position. On that basis, there seemed little point in pursuing discussions. The Deputy Prime Minister, Bri an Howe (in his role as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Commonwealth-State Relations), addressing a Melbourne journalists' lunch on Monday, November 18, on new federalism, accused the pre miers of ""walking away from the principles and timetable they had committed themselves and their governments to only one year be fore"". Mr Howe said the Common wealth ""remained committed to achieving the reform of service de livery arrangements and to improv ing the quality and efficiency of services"". He highlighted changes in the areas of health and aged care, urban reform and housing that had been canvassed in various function al-review reports. He stressed that the Commonwealth was determined to see that its policy objectives were implemented. There has been scant public con sultation on matters considered by the functional reviews. While there has been broad-ranging debate with in the community sector, it has been evident recently that the more dra conian options are not supported by the Commonwealth. There is little agreement between state and territo ry ministers on a preferred option in most functional areas. The document presented by Mr Greiner and Mr Bannon to Mr Hawke on October 8 proposed that substantive decisions on functional review matters be deferred until No vember 1992. They recanted on their 1990 agreement that these is sues would be resolved by the re sponsible ministerial councils. Therefore, they sought to refute their 1990 acknowledgment that reform of tied grants would hinge on minis terial council consideration of the functional reviews. The premiers suggested a new pro cess of review that bypassed respon sible ministers and centred on the establishment of a council of the fed eration. Mr Howe argued that such a strategy was directly contrary to the Commonwealth's established sys tem of Cabinet government. The Commonwealth position in the functional reviews angered many states. It was the Commonwealth that insisted that improved out comes for clients must be the starting point for any administrative reform. Mr Howe insists that reform will still be achieved He urged the pre miers to resume the processes they had agreed on in October 1990. While liaison with responsible state ministers would continue, Mr Howe clearly cautioned the states by sug gesting that alternative processes outside the special premiers' confer ence framework ""may involve a greater role for the Commonweajth dealing directly with service provid ers"". THE state and territory leaders' meeting in Adelaide on No vember 21 and 22 was very staid. There is a real unity over the finan cial difficulties confronting them all. The majority did not believe that isolating the Commonwealth would enable further meaningful change to be negotiated. The meeting reached agreement on a number of matters (such as elements of microeconomic reform, regulatory arrangements, gun laws, environmental protection, and so on). The communique did not ac knowledge that the Commonwealth had acted as the marriage broker for many of these matters, or that Com monwealth resources were critical to further progress. Some issues were just not resolv able, particularly in the absence of the Commonwealth. On the overall principle of tied grants, the premiers drew a line in the sand by asserting they ""would not accept any grants for new pro grams with detailed and specific agreements"". The major focus of the meeting became a search for ways to bring the Commonwealth back into play without losing face. It was resolved to seek six months' breathing space by lobbying the Commonwealth for an independent review of financial federalism. This review would con sider, in part, the merits of the states' proposal and examine overseas fed eralism models. A council of the federation was supported by all leaders. As an olive branch to the Commonwealth, Mr Hawke was to be approached to be come the inaugural chair. It is thought that the council might sup plant special premiers' conferences. However, the states did not resile from their pursuit of a fixed share of Commonwealth tax revenue. The financial difficulties of the states must be addressed. Collective ly the states face a deficit of $7.8 bil lion in 1991-92. A major factor has been a decline in the real value of Commonwealth financial assistance grants (for general expenditure) by 27 per cent since 1986-87. The 1990 Premiers' Conference saw a Commonwealth commitment to maintain the real level of financial assistance grants at the 1990-91 lev el. This is clearly not enough; all states and territories have wound back services funded from state-only sources. Services funded through tied-grant arrangements have fared little better, with some states now declining increased Commonwealth funds due to their inability to meet matching requirements. Some commentators predict that state finances will steadily improve if Australia moves out of recession rapidly. The Institute of Public Af fairs recently forecast that state tax receipts would grow by 7.5 per cent in real terms in 1991-92. Resolving the states' financial dif ficulties will not occur through the decimation of national income tax arrangements. The path must be to provide a genuine level of funding overall, with tied-grant arrange ments where the national interest is at stake. Future tied grants must be enforceable agreements, have clear and measurable policy outcomes, and ensure that the same quality of services is available throughout Aus tralia. While the new federalism process has stalled, it is now gearing up again. There is no barrier to the Commonwealth advancing the vari ous functional reviews through min isterial councils if that becomes necessary. For cooperative federal ism to stay on the road, the Com monwealth must retain the steering wheel. The states and territories have a fundamental role in sharing navigation with the Common wealth. The stalling of new federalism may, in the long term, emeree as a productive pause. It has re focused the Commonwealth and the states on the magnitude of the task in hand. The hard-line states' rights ex ponents have been sedated. There is a recognition in Canberra that the process could have been managed more diplomatically and openly. It should provide the space for an in formed public debate about the is sues involved, for they affect us all in fundamental ways. The secrecy en veloping new federalism has been one of its most unsavory aspects. As for Paul Keating, he will just have to find another issue.

According to a spokesman for the Minister for the Environment, Ros Kelly, the Government will not ""budge an inch"" from its decision to remove the huskies, as to do so could ""risk the col lapse of the international agreement'1. The agreement forms part of new pro tocol to be added to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, recommending the removal of all the non-indigenous species from Ant arctica, in an effort to protect the area's native flora and fauna from disease. The Government believes it is not the dogs stationed at Mawson, but new hus kies being introduced by private expedi tions which pose the greatest risk to the area's fauna, including local seal and penguin colonies. According to a spokesman for the Keep Our Husky Heritage Alive Task Force and former officcr-in-charge at Mawson, Ted Upton, the Government's rationale is unacceptable. Mr Upton said that Australia had a squeaky-clean reputation when it came to the Antarctic environment. The strict quarantine methods meant Australian bred dogs were disease-free. ""Only rarely has a new dog been intro duced to Mawson and that is after rigor ous screening for disease,"" Mr Upton said. ""The threat of them getting loose in penguin colonies is a problem associated with people not the dogs. ""There are clear instructions for the dogs' care and control. The only time a penguin is killed is if it wanders too close to the line where the dogs are chained. This happens only a couple of times a year,"" he said. Maria de Deuge, a geophysicist who works at Mawson, claims there is no evidence to suggest the dogs introduced disease to the seal colonies. Ms de Deuge believes concerns a,bout private expeditions bringing in their own dogs are unrelated to the role of the Australian huskies. Mr Upton said if the Government was concerned about the Antarctic environ ment ""it should turn its attention to fo cus on the pollution created by the machinery and the fuel spills on site"". Mrs Kelly's spokesman said Australia was the last out of the three nations to keep dogs in the area — including Argen tina and the United Kingdom — to agree to their removal. He denied that any of the Mawson huskies would be destroyed — a situa tion which reportedly occurred during the removal of dogs from the Davis and Casey stations in the 1960s. Mrs Kelly told Parliament that none of the dogs would be destroyed, and that they need not be removed before April 1994."	"colonies .

BEVAN The activities of the Bevan group at the British Labour Party's conference early this month brought to a head the feeling of tile party leaders that these ""snipers"" must be disciplined. The alternative rras it appeared to Mr. Attlee and Mr. Morrison was a disastrous disruption of the movement. This conviction in the orthodox leadership explains fthe uncompromising nature ;of the resolution which the ,ex-Prime Minister moved .at last week's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. 1 It was, in effect, an ultima- tum to the Bevanites to disband or suffer expulsion. Mr. Attlee secured a big majority, but there were too many absentees and absten- tions to make the decision 1 as complete a victory as he and his colleagues could have hoped. Nevertheless Mr. Bevan, who is a shrewd if emotional -tactician, cannot underrate - this demonstration of pro- found dissatisfaction with ' his group not only among .""the older politicians, but - also among the trade-union ?.Naders. No doubt he would 'ike to accept the challenge contained in last Thursday's resolution. Fortune had lately run so much his way that she might respond to a >boid call for more favours! But it was his very success at Morecambe, where he and his followers won six k out of seven constituency seats on the National Execu- tive, that led to this rebuff ""by the Parliamentary party. .. Seeing that Mr. Bevan was "" rapidly becoming the centre . of a rival organisation-a : party within a party, with its own meetings and its own Press-Mr. Attlee ""cracked down,"" and staked his own ,' leadership on the result. ,- Although the Bevanites' .reaction to the resolution ''may not be publicly defined . until after the group meets to-morrow, the indications are that their leader will nominally abide by the unity call, while seeking new ways to forward his so-called ""ginger"" campaign. Charac- teristically, Mr. Bevan tried at the week-end to put the blame for the present ""feuding"" within the Labour Party upon the ""capitalist"" newspapers. He hinted, with the delicacy of a pneumatic drill, that Mr. Attlee and others who had forced the showdown were not yet sufficiently sophisticated to close their ears to what these newspapers said. The truth is that Mr. Bevan, not his critjcs, has been appealing to the unsophisticated. Given his head, he might have wrecked Labour's chance of winning the next election. Mr. Morrison on Saturday emphasised that the party's responsibilities as the official Opposition and as the alternative Government de- manded that there should be unity in its ranks. No one knows better than he how much this faction fight, if allowed to develop, would handicap Labour at the polls. The fall in Labour's majority in the Cleveland (Yorkshire)' by-election last week was perhaps a sign on the wall, for since the general election of October, 1951, local election and by-election results had shown a con- sistent trend of opinion against the Conservatives. Unity and still more unity will be the party slogan from now on. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mr. Bevan has not, by his attacks on their leaders, opened too wide a rift between himself and the most .influential trade-unions, and whether he is not too strongly committed to his ""pure"" socialism, his anti-rearmament, and his anti-iimerican line, to walk in step with the present Attlee-Morrison majority in the Parliamentary party."

By ROBERT HEFNER, Literary Editor ""I don't fancy Australia myself,"" said Dora. ""My trick, I think. They say it's very rough, Australia."" She gathered in the cards, laid them neatly, criss-cross, upon her last gain. — From The Radiant Way, by Margaret rabble. SITTING under the rustling green branches of the trees on the quadrangle at University House on Thursday, and thankful for the breeze beginning to stir away the late afternoon sultriness, Margaret Drabble laughed when reminded of her character's rather sketchy idea of the land down un der. After only one day in the country, Drabble herself was not inclined to pass, judgment. ""I haven't had time to work it out,"" said the British novelist, who is a guest at this weekend's Australian National Word Festival. ""It's my first time here."" ' With 10 novels and numerous critical works behind her, the ""queen"" of literary London, as she has been described in the British Press, was not so reserved in her comments on the Ayatollah Khomeini's call for the death of novelist Salman Rushdie over his novel The Satanic Verses. ""What this grotesque incident has made one realise, in fact,"" she said, ""is how much freedom of speech we do have in Britain. I've always thought it was rather ridiculous to compare the amount of censorship that we have in Britain with the amount of censorship that happens in Czechoslavakia or the Soviet Union or other countries. ""I thought one of the most dangerous things about the whole Rushdie affair was when the Iranians picked up on the Peter Wright book, Spycatcher. ""Everybody seems to have forgotten about that, but I did think it was a very bad precedent. What the Iranians said was 'You censor your books when they attack your Government — why can't we censor your books when they attack our Government?' which, of course, is a non sequitur... But even so, it implies that they had spotted the fact that Britain had done something not particularly honour able. ""But I'd like to point out that that was nothing to do with literature, it was sim ply to do with the Official Secrets Act, which as a writer has never concerned me. 1 don't write that kind of novel. If I were writing that kind of novel I would be concerned about it."" Drabble's latest novel, The Radiant Way, was described by one reviewer as ""Dickenson in its desire to encompass the whole of contemporary British life, with its widening social and regional gulfs"". It is easy to understand why read ers in Australia would be drawn to such a novel, but what explains its appeal to readers in, say, Japan? ""I'd like to think the novels reflect a sort of universal feeling about how the world is growing up,"" Drabble said, ""and that some of these preoccupations are not either class-bound or country-bound, that they're real preoccupations that we all share whether we live in America or Ja pan or Brazil or wherever."" Among those preoccupations is the growing mood of conservatism and the swing to the right throughout the 1980s, and the concomitant conflicts between political, economic and ecological issues. ""I think it is possible to make a case, and I have made this case myself in print, that there is a kind of yearning on the Right for more censorship of television, of the Press, of journalism, of artistic expression,"" Drabble said. ""My hope is that the Rushdie affair will make people in Britain and in liberal democracies around the world realise how important it is to stick to the point and the principle, not to give in. I'm an eternal optimist!"" Despite this sense of optimism, Drab ble's vision of the 1980s, expressed so well in The Radiant Way, was of a failure of the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s, and of the growing rifts in British society. Though she believes the 80s have provid cd fertile breeding grounds for the New Right, she is hopeful that the next elec tion in Britain will put an end to this. ""On a very simple level, an awful lot of these people are fellow-travellers and time-servers,"" she said. ""They crawl out of the woodwork when there's a whacking Tory majority, and they'll crawl in again very quickly when you get a Labour or Social Democrat or mixed-economy gov ernment."" Though she was once a member of the Labour Party, she says she got fed up with it, and describes hcrsclfas a floating voter at the moment. Her concerns are more social than political, she says, and again she is optimistic that the next decade will sec a new kind of global politics emerging from the green movements. ""There are various people I know who believe that this is the new politics, that old-fashioned party politics, economic politics, class politics arc all finished, that we've now got to go into global politics and ecopolitics. 1 think there's a lot to be said for that. x ""I used to think it was interesting but minority, but now I think that there's a level of consciousness around the world. I'd like to think that it's not only because people are afraid of what's happening to the ozone layer but because people are fed up with partisanship and narrowness. But then you look at the Muslims and you see that they're not fed up with it at all,"" Drabble has completed a sequel to The Radiant. Way which will be published in September in Britain. Titled A Natural Curiositv, it follows the three main char acters of The Radiant Way into 1987. She plans to begin work on a sequel to A Natural Curiosity when she returns to London later this month. She recently completed the writing of introductions to all the Jane Austen novels for Virago, and they will be coming out later this year. There was a seven-year hiatus between The Middle Ground and The Radiant Way, which appeared in 1987, during which she edited the fifth edition of the Oxford Companion to English Litera ture. She confessed to a deep anxiety af terwards that she would never be able to write fiction again. ""I really felt I'd lost the knack. 1 went through about three months of acute anxiety [with the writing of The Radiant Way] and then when it began to move I was happy with it."" An accomplished etcher Joerg Schmeisser. Etchings from the Australian Landscape and other new work. Saturday-Tuesday, 12.30-5.30pm. Closes April 2. SINCE his arrival in Australia in 1978 from Germany, Joerg Schmcisscr has established for himself the reputa tion of being the most accomplished etcher working in this country. In part, his technical virtuosity has also been his greatest challenge. Having mastered by the time he was 30 a bewil dering formal complexity, with deliber ate references to the great tradition of German printmakers, including Wolge mut, Duerere and Cranach, as well as to his master, Paul Wunderlich, Schmeisser appears to consciously struggle with the tyranny of tradition and technique. The present exhibition of 42 recent prints, dating largely from 1987 to 1989, illustrates both a desire to progress from the earlier work as well as an inability to break completely from the earlier con ventions. It is always a temptation for a successful artist to capitulate to conven tion and to remain with a well tried formula. Alas, once an artist starts to repeat himself, altering only the subject matter and perhaps rearranging the for mal elements with an increasing degree of skill, the result becomes increasingly dry and facile. Schmeisser largely avoids this, I feel, only a few etchings such as, Diary and Jimmy's Islet (No. 7) and Diary and Port Campbell (No 4) could be said to refer directly to work he did 10 years ago, such as, Diary Shells and Dia ry and Ayer's Rock, with the common elements of topography, text and the de construction of the image into individual elements. Most of the other prints at the exhibi tion seem to take their point of departure from the series of remarkable Mount Buffalo rock faces that he executed in 1984. This is particularly evident in the striking portfolio entitled Rocks (Nos 8 17), where there is a successful attempt made to convey the sense of mystery and enigma concealed in the ancient weath ered rocks. They are as if studies in the archeology of a vanished civilisation, re mote yet sufficiently immediate and haunting to play on our sensibilities. The most radical and unusual work in the exhibition is the series that deals with sugarcane fires, particularly the two large triptychs, Nos 19 and 20. In a way they are not totally successful works. The al most abstract qualities with the strong, (lowing, spontaneous gestures, to me at least, do not always succeed. What the work does show is the preparedness to set ever greater technical challenges and to fight stagnation and complacency. De gas is reported to have once said that there is nothing remarkable in having talent when one is 25, the aim should be to have talent at 50. Schmeisser appears to be well aware of this dictum."

The assistants-secretary of the Australian Gas Light Co. Ltd., Mr. M. H. Rout, said yesterday that it was the first time the Government had ever been represented at a Gas Board of Inquiry by counsel. At previous inquiries, he said, it was thought that the Government nominee on the board was sufficient represen- tation. The board is inquiring into an application by the company for a review of its charges. On Mon- day the company asked the board to recommend an average in- crease of 13 1-3 per cent., which, if approved by the Government, would cause gas bills to rise by 12i per cent.

TUB WING FOBWABD. RUGBY IN AMERICA. Tho second round of the Metropolitan Rugby Union's competitions was played on Saturday last In weather well suited to the Rugby game.

Rugby cannot bo learnt in a day. but with tho sprinkling of oxperionced men throughout tho teams tho young players should Improve rapidly. a\t tho Sydney Cricket Ground Eastern Sub- urbs defeated South Sydnoy In a game that was always Interesting, by reason of tho dogged nc8s of the South Sydnoy forwards and the Btronuousness of tholr rushes. Tho team of ""unkqpwns,"" as they novo been called on account of the number of new players In the club, huvo ""made good"" in a surprising man nor. In Fusednlc the club has a remarkably fine kick; In Concannon a thrce-quartor of pro- mise; and In their forwards eight solid work- ers. a\t times on Saturday tho Souths van- guard had Easts disconcerted, both back and forward; but tho tricolours pulled themselves together, and ""won oui."" Eastern Suburbs on orcaslons showed good all-round forward play, and Iho hacks also put In some Ano dashes. The first try was a movo neatly executed, and wound up with threo mon fnelng tho full-back after some fine, quick pnsslng. Milner again played well, and In Wickham (diver and swlmmor) the team has tho makings of a most promising wing. Wickham played In the early game as I well, and scored twice by good runs. 'At tho No. 2 Cricket Ground Western Sub- urbs and Manly had n hard struggle for mas- tery, and ended up 5 points nil. Both teams attnekeil In turn, and but for the ublqultarlneSs of Ward Prentice, who played tho game of the day. It looked In many instances as though Monly must win. Prontlco seemed tireless; ho was excellent In every branch of Iho game. and on Saturday he gavo quito his best display for some time. Newtown Bhowed glimpses of premiership form In their, encounter with North Sydney, and although the shoremen lind as much of the Kamo ha the blues during Ihree-pnrts of play, the ünlshlng cITort of the premiers made n hlg difference in the scores. St. Georgo inced University at the Oval, with half of Its forward team standing down through Injuries, and carne through with fly- ing colours. Although defeated narrowly by ,1 points, ino game played was quite surprising to the 'Varsity player« and lo the few spec- tators.

In tho socond half University scored f> points (a converted try and a goal from a ftve), and ran out winners by S points to 5. It Is a colncldonco that In tholr two competition matches St. George should hnvo been beaten by n penalty (toni, and that the scores In tho Balmain and University mntches should have been S to 6.

A Sydney Rugby Union enthusiast hns re- ceived a letter from Mr. D. W. Burbank, manager of the American Unlvorsltles team that visited Sydney last year, which tells of (ho progress the game has made In America. Extracts from the lettor aro glven/herc under:- . ""I think next fall will be the best season yet by tory Every day brings news of new convorts, and although to us mostly Interested the advance seems slow, ""yet It is really remarkable the number of schools that hnvo taken up the game. 1 sec that Polytechnic High School in San Francisco, one of the bls gest In the State, as well as several smaller up-State schools, havo taken up the game for next year. Wo met defeat In the Los Angeles colleges, though 1 spent several hours talking to the directors. They had changed the rules of tho old American gamo, and wanted to give It a trial as changed. But It made rae pretty sore to lose them. Individually the members told mo that It was »uro to come next year, but I feel a bit disappointed. I otin'l tell you much nbout the progress of the playing of tho game from the technical point of view, ns you know I um not nunlllled. As for the gcnernl advance 1 know that the trip boosted the gamp boyond measure, and that It Is here to stay."" Cedric Cerf captain of Ihn Amerlcnn Unl viVriltleV I «am that visited Australia and New Zoaland last year, writing to n Sydney friend, also speaks highly of tho spread of the caine, as follows: ""The gamo Is sprondlng hero. The middle wost is thinking of taking It up. Kansas has it for next year. Wisconsin Is looking Into it for a trial next year In u minor way, and If It suits for a sure go tho yoar follow . Ing. It Is a 'cert' In California nnd Ne- vada. Practically all the schools are play- ing It now. Only a few about the Bay nni a few back In tho jungles are playing the old gamo.

Tho above letter seems to forecast the adoption of tho union code In tho University and schools of the western part of tho United States, and ns football is prneticully limited to these Institutions (no outside clubs ex- isting except a few In San Francisco tin-l thoso playing Rugby), It moans tho adoption of tho rules ""among nil players.

The Defend Australia League was formed in Sydney, initially by a group of responsible, thoughtful citizens in August 1962. It took the name Defend Australia League in January, 1963, and is still functioning as such, and independently of any other organisation or group. The Defend Australia Commit tee was formed in Melbourne in 1965 by citizens with similar aims and objectives. There is no relationship between the two bodies but the goal is a common one - the creation of public awareness of our changed rela tions in the South-east Asian area and the provision of realis tic defences to enable Australia to maintain its security and to fulfil its Treaty obligations. The ALP Federal Executive's action in proscribing the Defend Australia League and the De fend Australia Committee is a very dubious one, as it is now quite obvious that it was purely a tactic to rid the ALP of the troublesome Mr S.

A DAY, AT MOREE. FINE CROPS AND FRUIT. SOME VALUABLE WORK. (BY OUR SPECIATj REPORTER.) The goods and passenger train crawls along from Narrabri to Moree It crawls all the way, and the slightest excuse in the shape of a siding affords an excellent opportunity for an exhibition of shunting of which tho weary traveller gets the full benefit. But It it shat- ters his nerves there is ample time to recover before starting again at tho express speed of 30 miles per hour. Tho goldon rule obtaining on this branch line is, ""There's plenty of time,"" nnd it is rigidly adhered to. Ono evon tires at constantly looking at the wonderful mirages across the endless plains, and the beautiful lakes and picturesque islands they fancifully depict. As the train at length draws into Moreo station tho first thing that catches the eye of the visitor on the road opposite is a honrdlng bearing tho words ""Moree Ex- perimental Farm. Inspection Invited."" Pro- bably the latter words havo something to do with the constant stream of visitors who seek Information which tho Department of Agriculture, through tho farm manager, Mr. W. R. Fry, freely distributes. People come from all parts of tho State to the hot mineral boro baths-the curative qualities of which, particularly for rheumatism and gout, aro now widely known-and they naturally become In- terested in the farm, which adjoins. While thoro last week I encountorod a prominent Victorian politician, who was ""taking the waters,"" and was much struck with the valu- able work being carriod on at tho farm. Two squattors wore critically inspecting the fruit trees, and general settlers were plying the manager with numerous questions. A HEALTHY ORCHARD. The Moreo boro, which is 2792ft deep, was put down In 189G, nnd supplies a regular flow of 837,250 gallons per day. The temperature is about 11-ideg F., which is just about as hot as ono can bear the water. Agricultural operations were deoided on a year or two afterwards, so that a great portion of the land has now been irrigated for eight years. The farm embraces about. 200 acres, 80 of which are used for experimental purposes, and tho balanco are cut up and let to settlers in blocks of 15 acres, eaqh settler being en- titled to 18,000 gallons of water daily. The soil is black clay, which, owing to the heavy nature of the subsoil, would bo expected to be the worst possible for irrigation. However, the land is typical of thousands of acres in the surrounding districts, so that tho ex- perience gained should havo a wide appli- cation. The farm from start to finish is full of Interest, and tho lessons to bo gleaned in successful artesian irrigation should satisfy tho most exacting. Stepping into tho or- chard, one Is confronted with row after row of uno healthy trees. Hero aro tested nearly all kinds of fruits, including apricots, apples, almonds, cherries, citrons, nectarines, pears,' plums, poaches, grapes, oranges, lemons, man- darins, limes, persimmons, olives loquats, mulberries, walnuts, and quinces. In thl* collection there are, of course, Borne kinds that do well, and others indifferently. So far tho most successful havo been apricots, peaches, Japanese pluraB, grapeB, nnd lemons, while, on the othor hand, the climate has prov- ed unsuitable for apples, cherries, and English plums, which will eventually bo replaced with moro profitable kinds. Most of the fruit trees aro hi years old, and tho ground has been cultivated nnd irrigated with tho bore water for over seven years. Tho soil appears to be in good condition still, being very friable, and samples submitted for analysis showed no perceptible increaso of alkali. This fact alone is encouraging, and docs not bear out the oft-repeated contention that the bore water ruins the land in a very short time. The trees, too, have a very healthy appearance, ano grow luxuriantly, which they certainly would not do it the water disagreed with them. The oranges, mandarins, and lemons ob- tained this year were magnificent specimens of fruit, the first named being particularly largo and juicy, without a blemish on them. EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS. A portion of the farm, comprising 25 acres, Is reserved for teBting the reputed drought resisting wheats, and new crossbreds made by the late Government wheat expert, and to this part no artificial water is over applied. Twelve acre plots were planted last season, but owing to the actual rainfall from sowing to harvesting being only 384 points, the com- mercial return was small, although tho re- sults from a drought-resisting test were valu- able. Of the varieties tosted, ""John Brown"" and ""Federation"" matured tho most grain with this low rainfall, being closely followed by the Macaroni varieties. Those experiments are a valuable object lesson, but would doubt- lessly prove moro conclusive and effectlvo if they were carried out at a greater distance from the irrigated paddocks which adjoin. Moreover, water Is conveyed along tho side of the paddock to the settlers beyond, and any soakage, however slight, will materially affect the usefulness of theio valuable experiments. If this work w?ra carried out some dlstanco away tho pa-lilooks could be utilised for further irrigated opera- tions, as tho farm at present appears to be cramped for room. Amongst othor croos irrigated aro millets, which grow exception- ally well, rape, oats, wheat for hay, and green barley, there being a good demand for the lastnamed in dry periods. A fine crop of pcrghuni was also recently grown. It was planted in October, and irrigated twice with boro water. It grew to the height of 10 to 12 feet by February. An aero of lucorno, vhlch was planted five years ago, was cut seven times last year. It looks wall, hut owing to tho cracking nature ef the ground the growth is not too strong, especially as tho roots reach the clay subsoil at a depth of 4ft. Tho crop was a little patchy, probably owing to tho fact that tho plant Is most sensitive to stagnant water, and Is soon killed out in hollows that havo not been pro- perly graded. I ' TESTING SEEDS AND PLANTS. Quito a variety of seeds and plants are tested for suitability of wator and elimata. Somo result in failure; others again aro re- markably successful. Among the latter class 1b cotton, which grows particularly well. Two varieties havo boen triod this season, the dwarf Carolina and the Sea Island. The nrstnamed appears to bo tho moro prolific, but tho lattor grows taller, and the product is much liner and therefore moro valuable. One acre yielded 15001b raw cotton, the monetary return being estimated at over ¡C1G per acre. The crop was purely experimental, and as there aro no ginning mills nearer than Ipswich (Q.) it is probablo that the raw mate- rial will havo to be sent thoro to bo ginned. It is gonerally recognised that cotton will grow well in many parts of the State, but so far the great objection against its culti- vation on an extensive scalo has been the labour difficulty of picking. Somo farmers are cultivating this crop in, Queensland, and as the picking business is light enough for children the tanner with a largo family has a decided advuntago on his side. The ad- vent of the Lowery cotton picking machine, howovor, is said to ovorcomo the difficulty, and the reported importation of ono of these machines by the Queensland Department of Agriculture should prove of interest. Mr. Fry, who is a graduate of the Hawkes- bury Agricultural College is taking a keon interest just now in the cultivation of natural and artificial grasses. Complaints aro very often hoard that grass will not grow in boro drains. The exact reverse Is the case at Moree, and their rank growth causes a good deal of extra work in kooping the drains clear. Plots of native and introduced grasses aro also being tried, and the now RhodeB grass has been found to grow exceptionally well, the native star grass coming a close second. APPLYING THE WATER. Tho method of applying tho water is very slmplo. It is convoyed by galvanised piping about a foot in diameter to tho extreme end of the farm, and the water thon finds its way into an open drain, and from there to tho gut tors running parallel, about 4ft apart, through tho ploughed paddocks. Caro has to be exer- cised to koop the water in tho gutters, as once it broaks over tho side the ground soon swamps, and the growth of the crop 1b affect- ed The water when it loavos the piping Is hot-ono can just boar tho hand in it, and when running through tho paddock It is still warm, but the temporaturo docs not appear to I materially affect, cultivation. Indeed, In win ter it is calculated to have a stimulating ef- fect, and in summor a cooling reservoir, which is really a circular dam, has boen con- structed to reçoive tho water before it passes into uso. The ground soaked by tho bore water is very deceptive in appearance On the surfaco tho soil apparently is quito dry and firm, but tha moment ono steps on to it, one disappears two or three feet. A curious fact in connection with tho Moreo farm is that the boro is situated in the lowest part of the ground, and boforo operations can bo started tho water has to be taken to the highost por- tion of tho land. This is dono by the piping described, which cost the Government about £1000, tho necessary pressure being supplied by the water itself. It is not generally recog- nised that there is sufficient force of water at the boro hoad, 801b to the square inch, to drive a Pelton wheel, and the energy generated could, perhaps, bo successfully utilisod in lighting Moreo streets by electricity, or tho water could bo put to other uses, and still bo availablo for 'the baths and irrigation pur- poses. There is no doubt that the farm is carrying out useful work, and moro than or- dinary interest attaches to it, owing to the fact that the Agricultural Department has signified its intentlou of enlarging tho scope Of its operations at an early date. After sco ing tho results obtained at Moree, ono must be convinced that it is only a question of time before the wealth of tho enormous supplies of artesian water for irrigation will bo widely recognised. Boro water varies certainly, but that at Moreo contains far moro mineral and saline matter than others Which aro running to wasto, and therefore establishes a very fair test."

The main points to emerge were that the committee re garded indicative planning as a natural evolution of existing economic management tech niques; that it was a response to a growing demand tor co-ordin ated longer-term economic plan ning: and that the goals and targets were not imposed on the economy but were guidelines ar rived at by consultation between the Government and representa tives of the private sector. This is an outline of the machinery of New Zealand's economic planning; the country's experience with planning in the past couple of years and its relevance to the Australian situation will be discussed next week. The second plenary session of the conference was held in 1969 and adopted a series of recom mendations from the various sub-committees which estab lished a permanent planning structure. The apex of the pyramid is the National Development Council, which is intended to review the conference's targets and objectives, co-ordinate the recommendations of sector coun cils, and keep before the Government and the public the policy measures needed to achieve the targets and ob jectives. ADVISORY Tt is an advisory body only with 14 members, 10 of them from the private sector. The chairman is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and the deputy chair man is the Minister for Industries and Commerce and Minister of Overseas Trade. Its members include two perma nent heads (from the Treasury and the Department of In dustries and Commerce) and representatives of labour, manu facturing, farming, finance, science, education, commerce, a representative from the New Zealand University Students Association and a representative from the National Council of Women. It has a five-man secretariat located in the Treasury and it has a seven-man sub-committee, the Targets Advisory Group, in effect an economic advisory body, comprising the Governor of the Reserve Bank, a bank economist, representatives from the Treasury, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Federation of Labour and the Federated Farmers organisation. (Whether the Federation of Labour is still represented on the sub-committee is uncertain. The president of the Federation of Labour. Mr T. K. Skinner, resigned from the council on May 19 this year.) This group, working with the Treasury, the New Zealand In slitutc of Kconomic Research and the Lincoln Agricultural College Research Unit, had provided the technical and economic advice required by the conference and its committees to formulate its targets. It has developed economic models to test aggregate sectoral demands for feasibility and consistency. COUNCILS The conference also recom mended that the Government establish a series of sector coun cils, based broadly on the pat tern of the conference commit tees, relying on the advice of the National Development Council. There are now 16 sector councils each with its own plan ning secretariat: manufacturing, forestry, fisheries, tourism, dis tribution, education, environ ment, social, Arts, fuel and power, building and construc tion, overseas markets, agricul ture, transport, minerals and re search. The last six are organisa tions that were already in exis tence in these fields which agreed to act as sector coun cils. There are 163 council mem bers, including the members of the National Development Coun cil, although the number of committee members is 192 be cause some members belong to more than one committee. The committee membership break down is six Ministers, 46 de partmental officers and 140 non-government members. The National Development Council meets monthly and in cludes at each meeting discus sions with at least one repre sentative of the 16 sector coun cils. Most of the meetings are open to the news media. The National Development Council and the chairman of the sector councils meet jointly at least once a year. The joint meetings review progress towards targets. The NDC follows up the review early in each new year to prepare its annual report before the Bud get. Although the NDC is the major advisory body to the Gov ernment the sector councils have access to the Treasnry secretariat for direct consultation. They confer also among themselves. The conference recommended also the establishment of a com mittee of government and private sector members to examine New Zealand's statistical services in the light of the needs of the planners. The committee advised a revised system of national accounting, a detailed household budget survey, and the estab lishment of a central statistical information service. It said that there was considerably greater scope for centralisation of statis tical collections in the Statistics Department. At its first meeting the NDC set up a small ""watchdog"" sub committee to keep an eye on the extent to which its recom mendations were being imple mented. Of the 632 recommen dations approved by the 1969 conference, 542 were considered to fall within the responsibility of government departments. Before the conference ended, the Prime Minister announced that he had written lo a"" Cab inet Ministers to inform them that the conference secretariat would be providing cach Minister with a list of recom mendations falling within his responsibility. Rach of the government departments prepares reports on the action needed and the feasibility of implementing recommendations within their responsibility. The reports are accepted or rejected by Cabinet. Largely because the Govern ment used the 1969 Budget to implement or partly implement 31 of (he conference's recom mendations, the sub-committee was able to report four months after the -conference that some thing like 40 recommendations had been fully or partly imple mented or accepted as con tinuing policy. In a summary of action taken on recommendations to the end of September 1970, the NDC listed 631 recommendations (one must have got lost) with 336 implemented, 32 partially imple mented. 16 ""not accepted"", 18 deferred, and 229 on which action was still continuing. Neither the NDC's regular newsletters nor its annual reports specify the recommendations that have been rejected. The breakdown has not appeared since February last year. I Shares in oil royalties The American geolo gist who pinpointed the Bass Strait oil and gas field for BHP, Dr Lewis G. Weeks, in tends offering Austra lians shares in his Ber muda - registered ex ploration company which is undertaking a world wide search for oil. Formation of the Ber muda company, Weeks Natural Resources Ltd, was announced in Sydney ja Monday by Sir Howard Beale, vice-chairman of the company and former Federal minister and Am bassador to Washington. Weeks Natural Resources • is to acquire about 55% of the 2\% royalty that is payable on all Bass Strait production. The share of the royal tics being acquired by Weeks Natural Resources should provide the com pany with a continuing cash flow of about S2| million a year after tax. In effect the company will be capitalising part of I he royalties. It is under stood that the settlement ivill be partly in cash with [he balance satisfied by an issue of shares and long lerm notes. A prospectus specifying the details of the local share issue and the pay ments to be made to the royally holders is expected lo be available within a month. It is understood the initial share issue will seek lo raise between $10 mil lion and S15 million. No exchange control problems are expected in remitting the cash over seas, partly because the royalty payments are already being remitted overseas. Because the. payments are to be satisfied partly by a share and note issue the total amount being re mitted is certain to be less over the long term than under the existing arrange ment. Registered in the Bahamas the company will enjoy tax advantages and great mobility of funds. Sir Howard said the company aimed to pursue a vigorous oil exploration policy through the world including Australia. The chairman of the company will be Dr Weeks who is almost 80. In addition to Sir How ard other members of the board will be: Dr Paul N. Temple, a lawyer, and for mer president of all Esso companies in Spain, Mr L. Austin Weeks, a consulting geologist and son of Dr Weeks, the Marquis lie Casasoia, a lawyer and director of several Spanish corporations. Lord Green wood of Rossendale, a Privy Councillor and for mer minister in the Wilson Government. Barracouta Platform in Bass Strait The remaining members of the board are: Mr David E. Wilkinson, a lawyer and member of the Parliament of Bermuda, and Mr W. Frederick Christenscn, a Canadian lawyer and stock broker.

TWO YEARS OF POWER. Struggle Against Fascism. (BY A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) The formation and rise to power of the so-called Popular Front in France marked the culmination of a long period of economic and social unrest, which came near to plunging the country into civil war. Eighteen months before M. Léon Blum became Premier of a Popular Front Cabinet, the threat of a Fascist coup had become so definite that the Socialists and the Commu- nists signed a pact in which they resolved, among other things, ""to mobilise the entire working population against the Fascist organisations."" The Croix de Feu, Colonel de la Rocque's Fascist association, was at that time growing in power and in courage, and the tentative parades of strength which it staged were lead- ing to clashes of increasing seriousness. In- ternational anxieties called a halt to the in- ternal struggle, however, when, in February, 1936, the Franco-Soviet Pact was ratified, and, in the next month, German troops marched into the Rhineland. POPULAR FRONT'S VICTORY. It was on the heels of this crisis that the Popular Front came into power. Conspicu- ous among the planks of the Popular Front platform were measures against the Fascist leagues, measures to maintain the freedom of the Press, liberty of action for trade unions, reduction of the working week with- out a reduction of wages. The Left-wing group won a resounding victory at the polls. All the Right and Centre parties lost seats, the Socialists gained 45 seats, the Commu- nists 62. This was an emphatic verdict against Fascism. M. BLUM, SOCIALIST LEADER. It was inevitable that M. Blum, the leader of the strongest party in the Chamber of Deputies—the Socialists—should be chosen as Premier. M. Blum is a Jew, an intellectual, and a Socialist from his youth. His radical opinions extended to non-political spheres, and in his comparative youth he wrote a book on mar- riage, which, to his embarrassment, was trans- tated and reprinted widely when he came into power. He is not enormously rich, as has often been suggested by his opponents. In- deed, it has been stated that since 1936 the Paris dressmakers and milliners have been boycotting the ribbons made by the firm from which he draws his income, and that he has been in financial difficulties. The coming of M. Blum's Government heralded a period of comparative political stability, judged by French standards, but of unprecedented industrial turmoil. A wave of strikes began to sweep across France in June, 1936, before the new Cabinet had found its feet. Naturally the Blum Ministry handled the strikers with a good deal of sympathy, for it was they who had helped to place the Popular Front in power. Eventually it was agreed that employers should recognise the employees' right to belong to any legally constituted unions, and that wages should be increased by certain percentages. This was the foundation of France's ""new deal."" It was closely followed by the devaluation of the franc, under an agreement to which Great Britain and the United States were parties. Then the Blum Government embarked upon the immense task of nationalising the armament industry in accordance with the election promise of the Popular Front. No one could complain that the Popular Front, like other French Ministries, lacked either a positive policy or the courage to carry it out. After a new series of demonstrations by the Croix de Feu, the Blum Cabinet next pro- ceeded to dissolve that organisation (which re- appeared later with another name). It secured the passing of a 40-hour week bill (which it had later to modify). It survived demands of many of its followers for inter- vention in the early stages of the Spanish civil war, and subsequently instituted a vast programme of rearmament, in an effort to maintain the balance of power in Europe. FALL OF BLUM CABINET. The financial situation, which for a time had been stabilised by the devaluation of the franc, began again, however, to deteriorate, and one financial crisis succeeded another. M. Blum's Cabinet fell during its effort, in June, 1937, to secure the passing of a bill to give the Government wide powers to increase taxation and ""prevent action likely to injure public credit."" The Senate rejectcd the bill and all Government amendments, and, on June 21, M. Blum resigned. M. CHAUTEMPS AND M. BONNET. To restore the condition of the finances, M. Bonnet, a Radical-Socialist, who was then Ambassador for France in Washington, was chosen as Finance Minister in a new Popular Front Cabinet led by M. Chautemps, also a Radical-Socialist. M. Blum remained as Vice-Premier, and secured the indispensable votes of the Socialist party to the Ministry. The Communists, however, who had refused to support the Blum Cabinet's financial pro- posals on the ground that they would in- crease the cost of living, continued to with- hold their support. Thus one of the minor props of the Popular Piont had fallen away. For a time M. Bonnet's policy succeeded. In November, after five months in office, he was able to point out that the gold reserve had increased, that bond issues had been fully subscribed, and the tri-partite monetary agree- ment had been observed. The passing of large appropriations for defence gave an appearance of unity and stability in French politics in December. But the mounting cost of living bred fresh economic unrest, which in turn precipitated the present crisis."	"difficulties . The coming of M .

PREFERENCE URGED. British Manufacturers' Meeting. At the ninth annual mooting of the Aus- tralian Association of British Manufacturers and their representatives, held yesterday in the Chamber of Commerce building, the annual report stated that efforts towards securing preference from all Governments and public bodies for British manufactures were being made continually, but unfortunately had not been successful in every instance. During the past year a resolution was carried by the City Council, giving an ""absolute"" and not a ""per- centage"" preference to British goods, but despite direct representation by the associa- tion to the Lord Mayor, the Council not only rescinded the resolution, but also eliminated the ""percentage"" preference previously al- lowed, with the result that British goods have now no recognised definite advnatage over those of foreign manufacture. The position now is, as officially advised by the Town Clerk, that each tender is to be considered on its own merits, and the degree of preference to Australian and other British goods is to be left to the discretion of the Council. The association applied to the Tariff Board for in- formation as to its methods in dealing with applications received by it from Australian manufacturers applying for protection. The chairman of the board on several occasions publicly stated that before protection could be granted or increased, the applicant would have to prove his ability to supply a large per- centage of the market requirements, and also that no decision would be given until evidence had been obtained from all parties interested. As it would appear that in some instances at least this method had not been strictly ad- hered to, the council had asked the Tariff Board to notify it of all applications affectlng British goods, in order that when necessary the association might be in a position to col- lect information from members with a view to protecting their interests. Te chairman (Mr. F. G. Shrimpton) men- tioned that news had been received that day that all the Government departments except one had now agreed to a request by the asso- ciation that uniformity of practice should be followed in all the departments, particularly with regard to making the details of tenders lodged available for the inspectlon of unsuc- cessful tenderers. ""Efforts to promote the Imperial spirit must be quietly and subtly educational,"" the chair- man continued. ""The motherland wants the support of her children oversea, and while she looks with delighted and proud eyes on every effort they make to prove themselves self- reliant and self-supporting, she is surely en- titled to ask that they do not forgot her when they are wanting something beyond their powers to produce-for every penny spent out- side the bounds of our Empire is an actual loss, and a weakening of its power."" Mr. A. Simpson, Acting British Trade Com- missioner,' who has just returned from Eng- land, said he was struck while in England by the amount of unemployment in the Industrial districts. He did not know whether it was reasonable to expect a great country like Eng- land, that had prospered under a freetrade policy, to turn round and vote for tariff reform at such short notice. He believed, however, that the time would eventually come when something of that nature would have to be brought about. The following members were elected to the council of the association for the coming year: -Messrs. W. W. Anderson, Howard F. Hudson, J. B. Rumford, V. G. Shrimpton, C. J. Sparowe, and Geo. Thomson."

After its calamitous performance early this year the slide in its value from US72c to US67c has passed without media attention. Although our economy is g^wing strongly our currency is still weak, as Australians continue to import more than they export and as our inflation rate continues well above those of our main trading partners. News on the inflation front is hard ly encouraging and our trade balance seems unlikely'to turn around till there is a recovery in commodity prices. To hedge against any further weakening in our currency Australian Investment Advisers suggests that all investors consider an overseas invest ment. AIA docs not suggest you take this course only because of the weakness in the dollar. There are other good economic factors suggesting that there are some good investment op portunities. The most encouraging of the signs is the gradual recovery in the economics of old Europe. All the classical recovery signs are appearing. Interest rates, unlike our own, are declining, industrial investment is in creasing and there is a pick-up in consumer spending. In addition budget deficits arc sharply lower and inflation is still falling. In this more favourable economic environment most economists have raised their forecasts for Europe's growth from a sluggish 2 per cent to around 3 per cent. Also, because of the improving outlook, there is some expectation that the governments may ease taxes and cut interest rates. With Europe looking more and more encouraging the outlook for the world economy is also enhanced. This will help world trade and especially the United States, where fears of a recession were beginning to reappear, although the most recent statistics this week seem to indicate that growth may have resumed. *ALEC PIPER is the chief of research with Australian Investment Advisers Ltd."

Closer settlement, he said, should not be attempted on anything but an economical basis. It would not be economically possible ir land values were such as to put a, millstone round the neck of any settler. It was almost neces- sary for the Government to have some form of compulsion, to do something to those ""selfish people who would not allow the coun- try to advance."" ""MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION."" Sir Arthur Trethowan said it was the most Important question that had been brought before the conference. The community was looking about for a scheme to populate the rural areas and increase production. ""Unless we populate this country of ours wc are not going to hold it in the future,"" he pro- ceeded. ""We are holding it by the grace of the British fleet. If we did not have that behind us we would not be holding it very long."" _ , Sir Arthur Trethoxvan said the committee's report did not offer any solution of their difficulties. There were various classes of closer settlement. Graziers, for instance, re- quired a fairly large area. The Government should make a survey to determine the dis- tricts suitable for certain classes of production, such as grazing, wheatgrowlng, dairying, and fruitgrowing. Industrial residential centres should be established close to the city and other large centres throughout the Stale. He xvas not in favour of the Government going into the market and buying large estates. ""UNFAIR CRITICISM."" Mr. H. E. Elliott, M.L.A., said that unfair criticism had been hurled at the Government for what was termed its inaction in the matter of closer settlement. It must be borne in mind that when the present Government came into power it found the whole industry in a state of chaos. Should It then, at that stage, have embarked on a policy of closer settle- ment? (Voices: No, no.) Mr Elliott outlined what the Government had done to help the primary industries, and added: ""I think the time is now opportune to go ahead with such matters of broad policy. It would be a mistake, however, to run headlong into the question. We will only perpetuate the mistakes of the past if we rush into things."" A delegate said Mr. Elliott had hot told con- ference what the Government was going to do. Mr. E. Field (chairman) : I take it we arc going to tell Mr. Elliott what to do in this matter. SPECIAL COMMITTEE. Mr. W. Ross, M.L.A., said a special com- mittee had been appointed by the Govern- ment to investigate the closer settlement ques- tion. That report was submitted to Cabi- net in November last. It was very compre- hensive, and dealt with every phase it was possible to investigate. ""I can see nothing in it which xvould sug- gest that there was any necessity or excuse for delaying a policy of land settlement."" Mr. Ross declared amid loud cheers. ""Although I am a member of the Government and the Country party, I say that if the Cabinet dis- agrees with the report then why not say so?"" Mr. Ross said that if the young faimcrs and others associated with the land were to be denied the right of their natural en- vironment-the country-then Heaven help Australia. The stage had been reached when no Crown land xvas available and the demand for alienated land xvas more intense than ever. An appeal must first be made to people with large areas. If they did not recognise the national need it would be necessary to bring In legislation to make them do so. Loud applause marked the conclusion of Mr. Ross's remarks. Mr. R. T. Ball, M.L.A., said he could quite understand the difficulty of the Govern- ment, but he could not agree with the delay taking place. The difficulties must be faced. It was for this conference to point out to the countiy what ought to be done under the piesent conditions. After delegates lied discussed the conference sub-committee's report, clause by clause, the recommendations xvere adopted. NEW MARKETS. Tile Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Main) said that last year an alteration was made to endeavour to bring Into the bul1-, wheat of the State a fair sample of production. If the conditions of the previous two or three years had continued and the eyes had been picked out of the eiop, the larger proportion of wheat handled in the silos would have de- preciated still more in value. Last year the wheat in the silos compared more than favourably with the general average of wheat in New South Wales. The farmers who used the silos undoubtedly received a better price for their xvheat than would have been the case. The reason why Ilew .South Wales wheat, did not compare favourably xvlth xvheat from the other States was due to the treat- ment which It received at harvesting time. There xvas a large proportion of broken grain and rubbish. That matter was entirely in the hands of the farmers themselves. He asked them to consider very seilously the effect it had upon wheat values. The Government could deal with the rubbish, but It could not prevent cracked grain providing adverse samples. He appealed to them, as an or 'anised body, to give a little help in the direction of marketing produce, apart from xvheat, in Great Britain. , , ""There is one phase of closer settlement that will rcqulie some alteration If it is to be successful,"" said the Minister. ""That Is to discover markets where ,the production of these settlers can find an outlet. To-day we seem lo have developed the capital city complex In our marketing affairs, , just as in this State the capital city complex is very highly developed. ""Although Great Britain absorbs the great- est proportion of the butter we send ovei seas from Austialia, practically the whole of it is sent to the one centre-London. Reports from ? overseas state there are great oppor- tunities In the other big pentres of Great Britain, such ns Manchester, Glasgow, and other ports. That applies also to the other products. It will be necessary to &end our production to centres apart from London and Glasgow, to foreign countries and to the East, if we are to have successful closer settle- ment, Unless it is altered, our market in Great Britain xvill be limited. ""So far as the British Government is con- cerned, It has made a veiy sympathetic gesture to us in regard to our primary pro- duction, but, unless xve do our bit and open up the markets in Great, Britnin that aie entirely controlled by our foreign competitors, we cannot expand our maiket theie very con- siderably. Something must be done in that direction. Other markets In Great Britain can be successfully exploited, and we' will not be dependent on the one maiket."" REFERENCE TO RETIREMENT. I Referring to a suggestion that he would probably retire from active politics at the next election, the Minister sa'1 that he had been a member of Parliament for 16 years. Ho had a groxving ' family and thought he should give it a little more attention, It should be easy to find a successor. So far n the Department of Agriculture was con- cerned, it comprised an excellent body of men, whose one object was to help the man on the land. The advent of the Country party had brought into Parliament men who understood the requirements of the orlnurr producer, and who, from practical exoerkn« knew his vicissitudes. experience, HOME DEFENCE. An appeal to delegates to assist the Federal Government to establish militia regimen« for home defence in country districts was"" by Brigadier J. D. Richardson, commanding officer of the Cavalry Division, xvho was ac conipanied by Colonel C. C. Ridley of th headquarters staff, Cavalry Division (NSW) Brigadier Richardson urged the necéssi v for Australia's preparedness for wat? Z referred to the existing international position stating that the world was in the position of _ powder magazine, which only needed a lieht to precipitate a condition of affairs similar tn that in 1914 Australia was a vast contnent thinly populated, with nations on all sides starving for food. The object, he said, was lo make ourselves so .strong that it would not be worth while for anybody to have a ""go"" at us. ""As sure as the sun rises to-morrow"" ht warned delegates, ""we xvill fall like a'line apple to someone who is stronger than we are and who considers it worth while to lake action, unless we prepare for any such emer- gency."" Brigadier Richardson said it was not intended to create an army at present Th« men xvho were being trained were to be the nucleus of a force which could be mobilised if necessary. Every opportunity should be ' given to those men to become officers and non- ' commissioned officers of the future. He asked the delegates, as an association and as indi- , viduals, to get right behind the Government and to treat the cavalry division as a country t movement, giving it their support and encour- agement. '. Delegates warmly applauded Brigadier Richardson and passed a vote of thanks to him for his attendance at the conference ELECTION OF PRESIDENT. A few minutes before the time for lodging, nominations for office expired, Mr. D. Kelly said Mr. Field had not yet submitted his noml- - nation. Owing to Hie importance of main-, taining the continuity of tile association j j eflotts on several questions, he asked confer- ence to express Its opinion whether the un- 4, prcccdented action should be taken of a mfm-11 ber seeking re-election after four years in sue-. cession. Mr. Field sold he waa sometimes looked upon ' as an extremist with regard to the ambitions of the association, but only lecently he tod , been urged to Join another organisation, i because that body thought the Faimers and i Settlers' Association was not aggressive . enough. &lt; Mr. Field did not submit his nomination for &lt; the presidency, and Mr. H. S. Henley was . elected unopposed. Other officers elected were:-Treasurer, Sir A. K. Trethowan; vice-president, Mr. G. C, Roper (western), Mr. A. E. Budd, M.LA, (coast); councillor, Mr. C. A. Watson (coast). Elections will be held in regaid lo the other vacancies. TAXES AND DUTIES. It was resolved that, in view of the > improved position in employment, the special ¡ Income tax should be abolished; and that State and Federal income tax and special tax should be'allowable deductions In both State i and Federal returns; that the Federal Govern-, mont be asked to remove the sales tax on oils i and grease used in the production of primary produce; that the registration of farm tractors be abolished; that the wages tax be col- ' lectcd with the income tax; that probat«, duties should not be claimed on any one estate ' more than once in at least every 10 yean . from the same family; that the law regulattog i unemployment relief tax should be amended to provide for the abolition of la- on any . person receiving less than £3 a week; that estates under ¡C1000 be exempt from probate > duty by the State Government, and brought > into line with the Federal law; that taxation &lt; be reduced, and that the Federal Govern- ment's minimum statutory income tax exemp- tion should be increased to £300, in con- formity with the State exemption.

Mr. K. G.

Special precautions were already bein? tal-en to supply, in clean bags only, «« wheat used for experimental plots.

Everyone has accused the advertising industry of dishonesty for so long that the industry has responded by admitting its sins on-screen. It is not so much a case of truth in advertising, a new morality, as of involving the audience in its own deception. Take the television advertisement for the Kel- logg's breakfast cereal called Mini-Wheats — shredded wheat wrapped around fruit. Or is it? ""Kellogg's wants more apricots!"" the incredulous apricot pickers carol, while on the bottom of the screen Kellogg's admits in small print that what it actually uses in its product are dried apricots. It gets worse. ""Kellogg's wants more black currants!"" the even more incredulous blackcurrant pickers tell each other, while Kellogg's alerts viewers to the fact that the substance in its cereal is really blackcur- rant-juice concentrate. One can almost hear the subliminal voice-over: ""Hey, folks, we know that you know that we know that no-one from Kellogg's has any idea where blackcurrants are grown, let alone ever spoken to a blackcurrant picker on the phone, but we still think you are going to be sucked in by the rural imagery and buy our product."" Another example: the ad for a laptop computer, in which a man's car is crushed by a steamroller, but the computer in the boot remains intact. Do we really need to be told in small print that this is a simulation? Perhaps so. After all, this ad is made by the industry that tells us that if pain persists after taking a whacking great dose of codeine we should see a doctor. I thought I would just stay home and die of a brain hemorrhage. This is the industry which let itself become so carried away with its own version of reality that a brewery ended up holding a nationwide barbecue just because the television ad for its beer was based on the idea. This is the industry via which the telemarketers tell viewers, night after night, at hourly intervals, that if they ring in the next 10 minutes they will get a special bonus that viewers who ring in 11 minutes will not. I wait for the day when I will see in small print under these ads the words ""Not really"". Imagine the possibilities, if more advertisers adopted the practice of amending their visual lies with cold little words of truth. ""Bounty Bars are not really lovingly hand-made made on tropical islands but in factories in Port Melbourne."" ""Beer does not make you popular."" ""Facial moisturiser cannot arrest ageing."" ""Health insurance does not make you feel better. Medical attention might."" ""The odds are heavily against your winning Tattslotto."" ""This product is labelled 'reduced fat', compari- son-tested against a tub of lard."" ""These disposable nappies will still be around polluting the environment when your baby has died of old age."" ""The fact that 'Brian told you' does not mean he told you the full story."" ""Ordinary, sedentary people do not really need breakfast cereals created for top athletes."" ""Great gobs of margarine on top of food do not really make it taste better."" ""There is no evidence that God has any taste in the area of palette-knife painting."" ""The use of the word 'Jurrasic' in this program promo is not intended to imply anything other than a cheap shot to cash in on the popularity of the movie."" A word for poor old ACTION If I may, a word in defence of our poor maligned bus service, ACTION. I agree with some of the things the critics of ACTION have to say. I agree with the idea of part-time drivers, for instance. I agree that our buses probably do not need quite so many fresh coats of paint: car drivers are not going to be converted to bus travel by a paint job. But what I really object to is the mindless critic who claims that because public servants are being ""subsidised"" to travel by bus the entire concept of ACTION is somehow invalid. One well-known radio commentator has been heard to observe that, according to his highly scientific observations, the only people who catch ACTION buses at peak hour are public servants in suits and ties. Well, blow me down! Who else would be catching buses at peak hour? Why doesn't this critic have a look at who catches buses for the remainder of the day: the elderly person, the job-seeker, the housewife stuck at home without a car, the part-time worker, the shift-worker, the disabled person. If it were not for the ""subsidised"" public servant who, for environmental or other reasons, chooses to ride a bus to work, ACTION would be even less profitable than it is now. How many of the world's great public transport systems run at a profit? Last time I rode the Paris Metro it was stuffed to its high-tech, noiseless doors, and it still ran at a loss. That is in the nature of public transport systems in nations which regard mobility as a right to be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of occupation. If public transport is re garded as a social service, which it happens to be in this country, it cannot be expected to turn a profit. Many years ago, when I was a student, I lived in Ainslie and rode off-peak buses regularly. My fel- low passengers were mostly very elderly people and disabled people, a few draggled mothers with drag- gled kids in tow, the unemployed — the very people who are constantly marginalised by our society and who would be even more marginalised and even more isolated without the buses. My advice to ACTION is: let your buses run down, because nothing alienates your critics more than a shiny bus (take a knife and rip a few seats); and never let drivers sit and read the newspaper while they wait for their next run. Make them get out and pretend something is wrong with the en- gine. The sight of an inert bus driver is just the kind of thing calculated to make critics seethe all the way to work, where they will spend half the morning discussing this travesty with their workmates be- fore dashing off a letter to the editor criticising ACTION. The letter will almost invariably be typed on the departmental computer and be sent by the departmental fax machine."	"Facial moisturiser cannot arrest ageing .

Modern Dangers. ""INFIDELS ANcTcOMMUNISTS."" In an address at the opening of the 16th annual conference of the Catholic Education Association at St. John's College, Sydney University, yesterday morning, the Rev. Dr. C. Roberts, of the professorial staff oi st. Patrick'« College, Manly, told ft large gather- ing of the teaching orders that it was their privilege to co-operate In a special way In the Church's work of regenerating mankind by means of the Christian faith. ""No more than a fifth of the world's popu- lation professed the Catholic faith,"" he said. ""In addition to more than a thousand million of Infidels, there are some hundreds of millions of schismatics and heretics. In such sur- roundings the Church of God is placed, and hi this environment her children live. Pallen human nature is ever liable to act according to the unchristian spirit of the 'old man,' and not according to the spirit of the new creature in Christ. These are the factors which combine to make what Christ called the 'world.' The 'world' Is mankind estranged from Christ; unregenerate human nature with its vices, pride, greed, envy, and hatreds."" Dr. Roberts said that under the leadership of its atheist founder, Marx, and its atheistic exponents-principally Lenin-in this cen- tury, Communism regarded religion as the by-product of an economic system based on private ownership, and as an obstacle to the revolutionary changes required for the intro- duction of Communism. The Communists were trying to establish a state of society in which men would look back on bellefin God as a delusion, on Christ and His Church as imposters, on the immortal soul as a- fiction, and on heaven as an empty myth. They had their agents in Australia, who sought to train the young In the doctrines and practices oí Communism. Unfortunately the way had been paved for the Godless advance by the policy of maintaining only secularised schools. Lenin himself could not have arranged a more satis- factory beginning for Bolshevism. Dr. Roberts concluded by asking the teachers to make their pupils conscious of their dignity a.s Catholics, and to develop In them the strength of Christian character. The Diocesan Inspector of Catholic Schools (the Rev. T. J. O'Connor) was the celebrant of Mass in St. John's College chapel. Arch- bishop Sheehan, attended by the college rector (the Very Rev. Father J. C. Thompson, CM.), presided In the sanctuary. More than 200 delegates were present. In the afternoon the first session of the conference was. held in St. Patrick's Hall, Harrington-street, city. The Very Rev. Father J. C. Thompson, CM., presided. Papers on a ""Practical Lesson in Christian Doctrine"" and ""The Teaching of English Composition in First and Second Years"" were read by the Rev. Brother Edward, De La Salle College, Ashfield, and Sister Mary Anselm, M.A., Dominican Convent, Moss Vale, respectively. The conference will be continued to-morro\r and will end on Saturday._"	"fifth of the world's popu- lation professed the Catholic faith , "" he said .

A first trial, to determine among other things which eucalyptus species might be suitable for future hardwood plantations in the ACT, is being conducted on North Lyneham Ridge behind the new suburb of North Lyneham. Mr Richard Freeman, principal land scape architect with the NCDC, said yes terday that the ACTs demand for firewood was so great now that it could be said to be ""mining"" firewood, which was almost a non-renewable resource like coal. Dead timber from the ACT and the region was being cut up for firewood for the ACT and in the process the habi tats of various creatures were being de stroyed. The ACT had an obligation to minimise.its environmental impact on the widening region from which its fire wood was being harvested. In addition, the cost of bringing firewood from great distances might make it prohibitively ex pensive. (Some ACT suppliers are already charging $90 a tonne for yellow box, the most sought after fuel wood.) Mr Freeman said there were many thousands of hectares of the ACT which might prove to be suitable sites for hard wood plantations if the experiments at North Lyneham indicated such planta tions were viable. He thought such for ests would need to be as lai^e as 100 hectares each but that even with several large hardwood forests in operation it was unlikely the ACT would ever be able to grow more than about 30 per cent of the firewood it needed. The plantings at North Lyneham are of five eucalyptus species and at the mo ment, two years after the plantings, Eu calyptus nitens, the shining gum, is the star species. Observed yesterday some of them are already more than two metres tall although Department of Territories forester Mr Ian Gordon cautioned that it is too early to be sure that their rude health will be maintained right through to a harvestable age. Some of the plant ings at North Lyneham have been of species which occur naturally in the ACT (the shining gum is not one of them) but it appears to be generally true that they do nof grow quickly enough to be species used for ACT hardwood plantations. Those that appear to be just too slow for plantation purposes include Eucalyptus mclliodora, the prized yellow box. Mr Gordon said that North Lyneham Ridge would be ""Australian in charac ter"" although he could anticipate some purists being upset by it not being strict ly, locally authentic. North Lyneham Ridge is not to be a hardwood plantation, although some of its trees will be cut under a system called coppice with standards in which some trees (the standards) are allowed to grow to maturity while others have their cen tral trunks harvested with a view, 10 years later, to harvesting the new growth which this coppicing encourages. North Lyneham Ridge, which is about 30 hect ares, will supply some firewood but will also be a wooded place for walking. None of the elderly, original trees of the Ridge (which was once thickly forested but which after perhaps 150 years of sheep' grazing had become quite denuded) will ,be felled. They are almost old enough (between 80 and 100 years) to offer the holes and hollows required by nesting native birds."	"firewood it needed .

This shepherd, sitting on the deck of our schooner, wore crumpled khaki shorts, a dark blue shirt, and a straw hat. What mostly intrigued me was the object of his shepherding. It was wrapped in large green leaves, and obviously had to be kept in a cool place. A premature baby could not be hanàled with more care. I had to ask what it was. The shepherd looked mysterious, then whispered, ""Sausages!"" I gasped, then laughed a little shrilly. I wondered if he were sane. He laughed, too. ""When you have lived in the islands three months, you will do the same sort of thing,"" he said. I hoped he was sane, for six hours ago he had tied the knot which was supposed to make the other white man on the ship my lawful husband. Even in the Solomons, it was not usual to take the priest along on one's honey- moon; but on this occasion he had no other way of returning home. We were very much obliged to him, for it was no easy matter to find a priest to marry one in the Solomons. There, in 1937. it was not enough to wear a clerical collar. A priest also had to have a special licence issued to him from the government powers at Fiji. When my fiance received my letter to say ""arrange for our wedding."" it was not easy. Those priests with wedding licences, and residing close to Tulagi, were on leave, and so began a chase for anyone to perform the ceremony. At Maravovo on Guadal- canal the quest ended. The shepherd was brought into Tulagi. There we were married. There the shepherd bought his sausages. Now he was our guest on the honeymoon ship, and after all this trouble it would indeed be a misfortune should he be suffering a mental disturbance. His prophecy was partly true, it took less than three months to have me thinking his way. Within a few hours when the anchor went down at Maravovo. we were more concerned that the sausages should not go overboard than that we should not take a ducking. The Rainbow Path The mission was on top of a hill, and climbing that hill seemed like mounting a rainbow. Over the path hung the scarlet flowers of the flame tree. There were yellow and orange blooms on the bird of paradise bushes; pale indigo hibiscus, clumps of blue island violets, and the green of lawns and trees. Among these bright blooms stood the picturesque school houses. They were of native design, thatched from the ivory nut palms. Reaching the summit we paused for breath and looked back along the colourful pathway, across the strip of palms near the shore, where the shingle lay-a dark brown bed for the blue and white waves to play upon. The white schooner rode tranquilly, and the blue sea. under the noon-day haze, merged on the horizon with the soft blue of the sky. To me, a new arrival, it was a ; strange land. I thought I had never seen a lovelier or more restful place. ''If "" -, ' an angel appeared,"" I thought, ""and . . proclaimed 'Peace on earth, goodwill 1 ' towards men,' "" I should not be greatly _,* surprised. I said something about it -1 being a peacelul place, but the shep- ,, "";j herd laughed. ""You have not had .'""«.I time to meet our sandflies,"" he said. ""They see to it that there is no peace."" . (.. Then he became serious, and at once , I could imagine him with a crook and ' sheep. ""The only true peace is the , pe8J*&lt;* that passeth understanding i ¡' . . . . the peace a man carries in his I *«l, heart."" f j The shepherd's wife welcomed us to ! '. ;? their home. I confess I watched ? ' . closely as the shepherd handed her ¡ , ' the sausages. She was unfeignedly ..» I delighted. Her countenance could not k . have been more aglow had .she re- , ceived a casket of pearls. We had . v refreshments and talked. Then, for the . ' first time, my feeling of enchantment was shattered. There was a ""juchei"" from the shepherd and a shriek from his wife-and the cat was away with the sausages. What a clamour! Even ' the cat sensed the foulness of lils ?"" deed, for he dropped his prize and rushed off into the bush. The couple almost cried as they inspected the abandoned treasure, but cheered up .. . on finding the damage was slight. They were .serene as we said good-bye. ,, We descended the rainbow path. I '&lt; , was young enough to wish on my ,, wedding ring that the shepherd and his wife would always have peace in their hearts, and sausages more often -and some to spare for the cat. Flight Inland '*. Five years later a younger shepherd -f left Maravovo. He did not carry a : crook, but his flock followed him , t closely. They were his school boys. Sadly they left the school and the rainbow path to the Japanese invader, and lied inland. Nature almost drowned them in torrential rains, and the nights were spent in native huts drying their clothes for the morrow's march. There were flooded livers to cross, and the t1 narrow tracks were wet and muddy. ,¡ It was not comforting to meet groups ' ¡ , of frightened natives fleeing from the j Japanese, and the only peace was the ¡ peace that passeth all understanding, ' ' the peace the shepherd carried In his heart. On, over ranges, on, down rivers, until at last they were within reach ! of the goal. But now they were in ifa great danger from numerous patrols \w ol Japanese. From then on it was a . game of hide and seek with the enemy. Tile tracks had to be given to the Japanese while the little party cut their way through the bush. At last, footsore and ex-hausted. the little . .' flock was brought into the fold of the American forces. Now the peace of Maravovo Is the , . quiet of death. The shepherd's house , , and school are wrecked, and where ""' , flowers grew are gaping shell holes. ' ; But because there is still the ideal of ""Peace on earth, goodwill toward , l men"" in hearts of many men and nations. Maravovo will have a New . Order, and the shepherds will return."

One reason is that poets have effectively thrown away the rule books by which many poets and earlier critics were content to abide. Although now anything is possible poetically, critics and fellow poets insist that there should still be some form of poetic standard. Some point to their own work as an example of excellence, or insist that poems should have brilliance, life or originality — whatever they are. The point of this preamble is that much modern poetry has little to recommend it, by whatever standard. Because there arc no re liable yardsticks (if there ever were), critics are unwilling to be harsh in their judgments for fear that they might criticise a fledgling Yeats or Neruda. I find little to commend in Dane Thwaitcs's 'Winter Light'. The subjects he chooses to write about have the potential to become good or interesting poems, but he fails to invest his themes with the fire or magic which is the hallmark, I believe, of the good poem. His images feel laboured or plain tired, and they do little to excite the reader's imagination. The tone of many of the poems is languid, even passive, and the reader does not feel enthusiastic about the poet's perceptions. Some of the poems are close to being successful — 'Walnut' is one, but the poet misses the mark by ending the poem tritely. Some might say that I have missed the subtlety of the poems. To these I would say that poetry can be subtle and lively. In sum, 'Winter Light' is a dull collection, but no worse than many similar collections. WINTER LIGHT. By Dane Thwaites. Black Lightning Press. 68pp. $6.50. FREE SONG FROM IRON RIVER. By Radovan Pavlovski. Trans R. G. A. De Bray. Wintergarden Press. 62pp. $7.95. CANTERBURY FOLK. By J. M. Couper. Melbourne UP. 58pp. $12.50. Reviewer: PETER LUGG. J. M. Couper The translator of modern poetry has an important mission: to make available to the English-speaking public the very best poetry from other languages. This role becomes even more important when it is considered that English is such a dominant language that we never hear of poems from small coun- tries such as Yugoslavia. Pavlovski has been publishing his Macedonian poetry since the '60s, &nbsp; but this is his first English collec- tion. The book has a pleasant format with an excellent typeface and the Macedonian originals opposite De Bray's translations. Several of the poems arc accompanied by line drawings by Pavlovski. They do little to enhance the reader's un- derstanding of the poems, which deal largely with rustic themes. Although Pavlovski writes of owls and rye fields, he is not men- acingly modernist like Ted Hughes. Rather he is coy and un- ashamedly nostalgic like many contemporary Slavic writers, who are not embarrassed to sound old- fashioned. Unfortunately he fails to relieve the romanticism with which he imbues the countryside with humour (unlike Shukshin's fine stories), nor does he relieve the landscape with lyrical ten- derness, as docs Escnin in a hand- ful of his finest lyric poems. Many of the poems appear to trivialise the genuine pleasures of the rural life, too many arc un remarkable. It is not for me to decide if this is the fault of the translator, as I am not familiar with Macedonian. I would be sad if I thought that this was the best that Macedonian had to ofTer. By way of contrast, J. M. Couper's 'Canterbury Folk' is sheer delight. Couper seems to have resolved modernist dilem- mas by reverting to the style and form of another era of English poetry. He does not ape antique style entirely. Rather, he takes the flexibility of modern verse forms and uses them to recreate much of the atmosphere of Chaucer's verse. One must express amazement at Couper's verbal finesse. He can be subtle, turbulent and wanton within one poem. He can sustain several themes within a long sequence of poems in a way which would daunt many. He brings archaisms back into the lan- guage so that they are as natural as slang. 'Canterbury Folk' is a sequence of 39 poems in a collection which also contains a shorter verse se- quence and some excellent ver- sions of Horace. The only contem- porary poet I can think of who so readily enters the past is Geoffrey Hill, and he is fine company in- deed. For those who enjoy the old poetic forms as well as those who think that poetry is dead, this book should be a pleasant surprise. For those who write poetry, Couper should remind them that all is not lost. Social mixing A GLORIOUSLY glossy prod uction, which reproduces lovingly prepared glasses containing brilliantly coloured cocktails, this book sets out to make the mixing of cocktails at home so simple that results arc guaranteed and that enthusiasts might even go on to create their own. But it is more than that; a minor textbook on alcoholic drinks, from extremely dry martini to beer (but excluding wine) which adds non alcoholic drinks for good measure. It gives a history of the forms of alcoholic material that people put into glasses (and cups, with coffee) beginning with whisky (correctly spelling it ""whiskey"" when refer ring to American and Irish types) and going through brandy, gin, rum, vodka, tequila, sake, cham pagne, aperitifs (sherry, vermouth, Dubonnet, Byrrh, Rosso Antico and Campari) and liqueurs (Galliano, Tia Maria, Midori, Cointreau, Baileys Irish Cream, Grand Marnier, Southern Com fort, Drambuie and Benedictine). Wine is not included bccausc it is not, generally, considered a mixer. There is a fascinating list of things to mix from liqueurs, including ""Wild Strawberries"" (Drambuie), ""Moonglow"" (Benedictine) and ""America's Cup"" (Southern Com fort). It also gives a description of the manufacturing and/or distilling processes (although on sake it is very light and on Benedictine two separate references appear to have been written by different people, one giving an authoritative-sound ing version of its origins in the 16th century and the other saying it was ""supposed to have"" had those origins). It gives excellent advice on setting up a bar at home, precautions to take to ensure suc cess in mixing, and basic stock lists. There are interesting last sen tences in the sections on spirits, recommending the mixes to put with each. Lovers of fine Scotch will be pleased to know that Tirado draws the line there: he merely says ""some very popular Scotch based drinks arc ..."". The punchcs section includes a non-alcoholic one and there are nine recipes in the ""non-alcoholic drinks"" section. Nine is a pretty good go for non-alcoholic mixtures in what is, after all, a book by a genuine lover of booze: the number of recipcs in all sections is limited, sometimes only half a dozen. In the euph mistically labelled ""pick-mc-ups"" section, there arc only five, and the last one is a last-resort type: ""Eddie's Cure — 2 headache powders. I glass of water; return to bed with this book"". An excellent Christmas gift for dedicated home entertainers, it is COCKTAILS AND MIXED DRINKS. By Eddie Tirado. Lans downe. 112pp. $17.95.

Nobody really buys a bike for any other reason than that it makes them feel good. If you accept this as fact, then I think I have found the ultimate motorcycle. Forget all about light-weight high-tech sports bikes that can hurtle you through the sound bar rier. This bike is old-fashioned, slow, heavy and doesn't even handle that well. What it does do, however, is put a smile on your dial every time you throw a leg over it. As you may have guessed, I have fallen in lust with a Harley. Not any Harley, a FLST Heritage Softail. The Heritage has been modelled to bring back fond memories of all those who can remember motorcycling in the Fifties and Sixties. I'm too young to remember but I will admit to liking the lines of the Softail and the nice little tou ches of the Heritage such as the leather saddle trimming, foot boards, spoked wheels and saddle bags. The Heritage is powered by the latest evolution version of the famous V-twin. At I340cc it's no lightweight, but produces only a modest power output compared to most modern engines. What it does have is truck-loads of torque. The two-wheel ver sion of a V-eight, all that is required to attain instant response from the Hog is to give the throttle a twist no matter what the gear or how many revs you have up. The massive dose of torque, delivered by the motor really sets the character for the bike. Riding the Harley is a very lazy expe rience, with the rider able to hold fourth or fifth gear for ever and just roll on or off the throttle as required. I was expecting the big twin to have its fair share of vibration and shake but the evolution motor is commendably smooth. There is just a hint of rock through the frame sitting at idle but it disappears once under way, leaving just enough vibes to remind you that you're sitting on a V-twin. The other pleasant surprise was how easy the beast fired up each morning. No choke was needed and it quickly settled down to that nice lumpy idle that is part of the appeal of a V-twin. All that grunt from the engine requires a gearbox that would do justice to a Ken worth and the initial impression is that it might actually have a truck box fitted. No matter how 1 tried to change gears the result was the same: slow, clunky and noisy. Fun ny what a bit of practice will do, though, for by the end of the test my changes were still slow but they were smooth and precise. The m clutch also proved to be smooth and pro gressive with no tendency to snatch. The drive train is finished offby a Kevlar reinforced drive-belt instead of a chain. This has proven to be very successful since its introduction a decade or so ago, building up a reputation for strength and reliability. The Softail differs from the rest of the Harley Davidson range by having a unique rear suspension set-up which consists of a pair of under-slung shocks working an A arm set-up. The front is a more convention al pair of 39mm forks holding a massive 130/90X16 tyre which matches the rear tyre exactly. Both tyres are mounted on spoked wheels. The result is surprisingly good. The bike turns in well at speed and is reasonably shaip in the steering despite having 31 de gree's of rake and nearly six inches of trail. CORNERING speeds are restricted by an almost total lack of ground clear ance, which is OK because it is completely out of character to go around scraping the foot boards anyway. The sheer bulk of the Softail becomes evident if you happen upon a sharp bump mid corner. The tail gives a little buck and a skip before settling down. The feeling might not be dramatic but it sure makes you sit up and take notice. Slow-manoeuvring the Harley proved to be an easy enough job, thanks no doubt to the low centre of gravity, wide bars and very low seat height, a mere 26.5 inches. If there is a drawback with the bike it is its brakes; they are just not good enough. The single front disc has a heavy wooden feel and won't stop the bike from even modest speeds. The rear is better and must be used if you ever need to stop in anything like a hurry. The Heritage must have one of the most comfortable riding positions on the market. The seat is low and very well padded while the bars are a comfortable reach away when sitting bolt upright. THE FOOTBOARDS are well forward and are perfect for cruising around for hours on end. The pillion seat is nearly as sumptuous and has a low sissy bar to lean back on as well as plenty of leg room. The best part is that there is no shortage of volunteers to keep you company on rides. The finish on all recent Harleys that I have seen has been superb, with acres of quality chrome and first-rate paint, all of which helps when you are asked to hand out $ 15,800 plus ORC for your new toy. At least you can reasonably expect it to retain its value until you are ready to trade it in. Me, 1 think I would keep it forever. Sure you might want another bike or two for a few quick blasts every now and then, but when it comes to those sunny Sunday mornings you'd find yourself heading for the Harley. Nothing else gives more smiles per dollar and you can even get a buzz out of riding it at legal speeds around town. Try that on your 130-horse Jap superbike."

The Mlnlstar Xor Lauds (Mr. Buttenshaw), speaking at the annual meeting of the Parks and Playgrounds Movement of Mew South Wales, at the Millions Club last night, said the Government was in sympathy with any move- ment for the preservation of lands for recrea- tion or beautification purposes. Before Crown lands were disposed of, every considera- tion would be given to future requirements. Unfortunately, the Cabinet was not in a position to provide more than £0000 in the present estimates, said Mr. Buttenshaw, but in the near future it was hoped that £60,000 would be made available for the acquisition of new playing fields. In certain cases, con- sideration would be given to the question ot selling unwanted Crown lands lo purchase private areas. Where there was a likelihood of the community losing a certain spot which was too ccstiy to buy in a lump sum, the Government would consider the justification of asking posterity to assist to pay for it by a long-term purchase. Mr. Buttenshaw added that since he bscam'j Minister for Lands, he had made available, with the npproval of the Cabinet, Crown land.* to the value of £250,000 for recreation pur- poses. At present, he had requests for arcas valued at. £261,000. The secretary (Dr. C. E. W.

Her letter was reminiscent of the 19th-century arguments in support of creationism to count er the new theory of Darwinian evolution. Bishop Samuel Wil berforce and his fellow creation ists simply ignored the fossil re cord. Those who today refuse to believe the world is overpopu lated also ignore the scientific ev idence. What is this evidence? Since 1984, global grain output has fall en 1 per cent a year on a per capita basis. The amount of crop land has not increased since 1981. Expansion of irrigated areas has not kept pace with pop ulation growth since 1978. Growth in fertiliser use stopped in 1990 - in the Western world, to have increased its use would no longer have been economical ly viable. Agricultural technology and the development of new strains made their great advances in the 1960s, but there has been little since. Global meat production has not increased since 1987. There has been a 7 per cent de cline in fish stocks from 1989 to 1992. Oil production peaked in 1979. Coal production, after con tinuous growth for two centuries, dropped in each, year from 1990. Meanwhile the population grows by a quarter million peo ple a day. As Lester Brown of the WorldWatch Institute said in The Washington Post in August, there is a ""collision between ex panding human population and needs, and the constraints of the earth's natural systems"". No-one disputes, as Ms Joseph claims, that corrupt and ineffi cient government, civil wars and massive inequity of resource dis tribution play their part in block ing ""sustainable development"" (a loaded term, and possibly an oxymoron). Nevertheless, to dis miss population growth as a fac tor is absurd. Instead we should heed the warning of leading scientists, not least the Royal Society of Lon don and the US Academy of Sciences, that if current patterns of resource use and population growth remain unchanged, sci ence and technology may not be able to prevent either irreversible degradation of the environment or continued poverty for much of the world. AESP rejects the various epi thets thrown at it by Mrs Joseph.

Slowly the realisation is creeping through, as we watch Phytophthore ec. take hold of Western Australia's jarrah forests, or the die-back — particularly in New England but now throughout the eucalypts of the eastern States — or the logging for chipwood to supply the hungry maw of Japan's paper industry (it is in- treating that they do not use their own forests for this purpose), that the country will soon be denuded of everything except a few pine forests. Despite this realisation, it is never- theless incredible that the ignorance and greed that has led to this situ- ation is allowed to continue. In- credible that in Africa, with all her problems, a country like Kenya can plant 15 million trees a year when we do nothing other than plant pinus radiata. What should be happening — and let us hope 1982 will see the start of this — is that farmers should be given incentives to plant hardwoods rather than to clear, that the various Federal and State government agen- cies such ar the CSIRO, forestry, soil conservation and planning authorities are co-ordinated to or- ganise :a nationwide planting pro- gram; that local authorities and the many service organisations are co- opted and that an educational drive is mounted, and that employment in the field is offered to those who are unemployed. Powerful government leadership is required. Will it be forthcoming? Tree-plantine throughout Aus- tralia is required to hold back coastal eosion and the encroachment of desert areas; to increase humidity A view of the treeline from Lake Burley Griffin: ""Anyone who has been away from Canberra for some time will remark on the change—"" and lower evaporation in the dry areas, to prevent erosion from wind and scouring, and to bring back fertility to the ground and to en- courage our native fauna and flora. In fact, the gains are endless. Strangely, or perhaps merely less understood, is the fact that some of the greatest advantages can occur within the city conurbations. It is here, in the centres of our cities, that heat build up in summer is creating a rising funnel of air that draws in more heat and dust and exhaust fumes. It is here that winter winds can ricochet down corridor streets and bore down the sides of high-rise buildings. It is here also that the great majority of Australia's popu- lation lives or works. Trees can effect a considerable change for the better in providing comfort conditions for pedestrians. They provide shade, changing pat- terns of light, colour, purify the air and absorb ground water and enhance both the appearance and the efficiency of buildings. The shade provided by trees can measur- ably lessen the air-conditioning loads on buildings. Above all, they convert urban moonscapes to congenial sun- dappled groves and in the process, when planted in parks and other open spaces, become a valuable re creational resource available on everyone's doorstep. It is for these sorts of reasons that the idea of urban forestry has been introduced — this, and for the fact that the establishment, maintenance and harvesting of forests throughout the world will provide a sink for atmospheric carbon, dioxide. In some definitions urban forestry is applied to the planting of trees in cities for productive use, and there is nothing amiss in the idea that selective felling be used to provide timber for commercial use and for firewood. Cities such as Zurich and Chicago have for years had urban forests that more than pay for themselves. Last year Dunedin was able to lower its rates from the profit of its forests, although in this case the forests are on the periphery of the city. Essen- tially the benefits of urban forestry are as described, although it is help- ful that they can be a viable economic proposition for any city council contemplating such schemes. It should be noted that the real benefits of urban forestry are not gained from merely putting in a little street or park planting, beneficial although this might be. They come, in a view that I first put forward in the book 'The Green City' in 1979, and through a 1980 report that is now being implemented in Auckland, from linking urban forest- ry with other planning notions to form a total transportation-open- space-climate-control-recreation sys- tem. In such a system all available open spaces, including parks, verges and unused land of all sorts, are linked by cycle and path systems that lead to express bus-stops. Streams may be rediscovered as a basis of such a system. Infill housing is introduced to overlook these spaces andevery space that does not for some reason need to be kept open is planted with forest-scale trees. In a sense, it gives a raison d'etre for the medium- density infill housing that has failed up to now to gain support in Can- berra, possibly because of the haphazard locations proposed. To understand the proposal better it might be useful to see how it might apply to Canberra, although its ap- plication has been seen to be most urgent in areas such as the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. Small feeder buses (Kombis, dial- a-bus, or mini-cabs) would take the elderly or disabled, or others in wet weather, to bus interchanges, at Woden, Beloonnen, Civic, Kingston and Queanbeyan. These in- terchanges would be linked by ex- press buses with stops at about two kilometre intervals. Cycle paths and pedestrian ways would lead by linked open spaces to these stops allowing people to walk, or take a folding bike, or to stow their cycle on the bus. These linking spaces would then be planted with trees and form ""green ways"". In some cases streets would be converted to green ways. In this way people would be offered the option of saving valuable fuel resources, cutting. their transport- ation costs and conceivably enjoying their journey to and from work. These green ways would be so routed to connect with schools, shops and other facilities and a variety of activities could occur along them. Canberra for long has been noted for its trees, and with ever-increasing cause. Anyone who has been away from Canberra for some time will remark on the change that is overtaking the central area in partic- ular. For those of us who live here it is one that has crept upon us almost unaware. All of a sudden, in most of the areas that are not still in the pioneering stage, trees are achieving dominance over the buildings. To look north across the lake from the parliamentary triangle, for in- stance, one now sees a carpet of trees interspersed by only the largest buildings. Driving along Yarra Glen to Woden the grove of aspens planted to screen off Curtin is now a wall of trees giving a very French feel to that particular area. The peninsula on the Melba side of Lake Ginninderra that was forward planted as part of the NCDC policy for Belconnen now looks so well that it is unlikely that the original idea of cutting out trees for residential building will ever be pursued. Similarly, as the temporary stop- gap planting of Parkes Place matures, either the 1971 plan for a national place or the present NCDC plans for Ailing the area with build- ings become progressively less likely of implementation. Other than in the parliamentary triangle, where past piecemeal plant- ing should not be allowed to form the only basis of a landscape design, all this growth is nothing but good. The triangle is something of a problem area. The 1971 plan ex- tended the eucalypts of Capitol Hill, which was kept as part of a ""peace"" park, as a forest down around a Camp Hill Parliament House and between Commonwealth and Kings Avenues and Parkes Place. The dom- inant tree species would have been indigenous, as befits an Australian national area. The trees of Capitol Hill have now gone to be replaced by very ex- tensive building works and slivers of gardens which need to tie in with a landscape plan for the triangle itself. Without doubt many existing trees will need to be felled and it will be interesting to see if public and parliamentary opposition will make any new plan impossible to imple- ment. For the rest of Canberra, this growth is entirely to be admired: Not a little of the verdure has come from private planting and it emphasises the pathetic cerebral level of the Lynch Committee recommendations that one of these was the termination of ""free"" (the cost was, in fact, covered in the land price) trees and shrubs to new house owners. Good as has been the tree-planting of Canberra to date, this article makes the case that many more thousands of trees could now be planted with advantage. Areas such as Yarra Glen and the spaces that were meant to separate Tuggeranong from Woden from Bel- connen from Civic; all those acres of verges to the parkways, the bare hills such as Mt Taylor, the many many surrounds to playing fields. The westerly gales would be mollified, the fumes absorbed, the loose building form given structure, grateful shade made available, bird life increased, and a valuable source of revenue provided. Here is the opportunity for the national capital to lead the nation in the Year of the Tree and become an example to the rest of Australia: for the next 100 years, if not for all time. It remains to set the wheels in mo- tion. • Roger Johnson is head of the School of Environmental Design at the Can- berra College of Advanced Education and author of the book ""The Green City."""

The conference convened by the Primo Minister, of representatives of the various unions interested in shipbuilding, will open, in Melbourne to-day. It Is interesting as a sign of the times. Here is the Austra- lian Government impressed with the view that it Is Imperative to tackle what for us Is the novel enterprise of shipbuilding, but refusing to go on unless it is nssured of the hearty co-operation of organised la- bour. The Government says in effect that it will find the money, that it will see to the supervision, and generally tako ¡the responsibility for success, but only it i the unions on their part agree that the employer-in this Instance the whole of the people of the Commonwealth-gets a [fair deal. If now rests with the unions I to say whether or no they are prepared ' to play the game in this hour of national crisis. No doubt the more moderate union- ists will readily agree. They will rea. liso that the mero fact of the establish- ment of so important an industry as ship building must absorb a lot of labour, and so materially add to the avenues of em- ployment They will realise, also, that if the Commonwealth Government as re- presenting the people of Australln cannot do what is fair by them as employees, no one can. This idea of obtaining guaran- tees from unions is a new development in stateseraft It was first applied by the Prime Minister in connection with the Queensland sugar industry. As to what will be tlie binding effect of such agree- ments only timo can show. This much is clear, however, that any flouting of the supreme Government in war time is a very different thing to refusing to carry out nn agreement entered into with private employers.

The museum should be located on a site which best suits the museum concept, but what of the Parliamentary Triangle? Clear- ly there are development plans in the mak- ing, and as residents we need objective criteria for assessing those plans. A city is the focus for a community of people and will change as the aspirations and needs of people change. As the city succeeds in its role as a vital community centre the more likely will be the pressures for change. Successful cities attract people who want to share in the benefits of the city, and expansion and development follow. Un- successful cities promote a move away from the city centre as other places take over as a focus reflecting the communities aspirations. What of the city of Canberra? As a rapid- ly expanding community with a great pride in our city, change is inevitable. With the introduction of self-government we have a new awareness of ourselves and the com- peting functions of our city. As Australians we are proud of Canberra as our capital city. As residents we want to ensure the quality of life in our city. Each city has many layers which together add a dimension to the city, sometimes measurable sometimes intangible. Can- berra, whose beginnings are still within human memory, has its own unique layers of influence. Located within a ring of mountain ranges it will always be a city in the natural environment. Our inheritance from the Aboriginal people since the Dreamtime, and of the Ngunawal and Ngarigu people who ranged across the plains before white settlement, is a further layer. Their colourful description of Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie as women's breasts, Nganbira, is remembered in the city's name. European occupation began in 1820 when Governor Macquarie led a party to inspect the farming possibilities for the region. Five years later sheep were grazing on the Limestone Plains. The settlers have left a small legacy of buildings to remind us of our early pioneers. Since 1911 Canberra and the region have played a role in the observation of stars and stellar systems in outer space. From those early beginnings Mount Stromlo Observa- tory grew to be the largest observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. The public sense of wonder such activi- ties induce far exceeds the scale of the physical development, and adds an intan- gible quality to the city's sense of self as a participant in the future. Walter Burley Griffin's plan for Can- berra is the fifth of the layers of our inherit- ance. The central triangle and lake follow his proposed layout. As the areas further from the city centre were developed in later years, new attitudes to city planning were taken into account and merged with the spirit of Griffin's plan by planners with an evident deep understanding of the influ- ences on Walter Burley Griffin. Now that through self-government resi- dents of Canberra also have the opportuni- ty to contribute to Canberra's planning there is a need to make ourselves aware of those things which through Griffin's plan are part of our inheritance. As our city has been minutely planned in the past there is the possibility of a reac- tion, of feeling that through marketplace development we can set aside the past and create anew. The experiences of the cities of Melbourne and Sydney may help in determining the way forward. Both have faced considerable change over the years. THE CITY of Melbourne was planned by Robert Russell. Laid out on a grid of streets about two kilometres across, the two sides of the city are bordered by rail- way lines, with parks to the north and east. A great deal of building activity took place in the boom conditions which followed the discovery of gold, and by the 1880s the city contained many of its fine Victorian build- ings. The grand vision of the gold era laid the foundation for the next century, as the city provided a central location for the expand- ing suburbs. &nbsp; By the 1950s change was slowly creeping into the city. As new affordable cars re- placed public transport the twice-daily riv- Change should be worthy of Griffin's Image er of people through the city from Flinders Street Station became a stream. Coffee at the desk replaced the emptying out of of- fices into the surrounding shops. The first suburban retail precinct was built. The flow of people on whom the city depended for its vitality was diminished. The relocation of federal departments to Canberra, and decentralisation, were eat- ing away at the functions of the city. In the 1970s green bans placed by the union movement failed to stop the destruction of many of the old buildings at the ""top end"" of Collins Street. The will to preserve pub- lic buildings was lost. Ironically the unfashionable western end of Collins Street, which had escaped much of the developers' attention, began to thrive. Full of arcades and laneways which were once a dominant characteristic of the whole of the city, a new buzz of activity centres around the legal and banking pro fessions. At lunchtime tables spill out into the laneways from eating places located in recycled buildings, and in the evening con- verted warehouses throb to the nightclub beat. With the demolition and redevelopment of the ""top end"" of Collins Street came the public realisation that a change had oc- curred to the city. The new City Square built in the late 1970s in Swanson Street, a grey block con- struction, was expected to right the wrong that had fallen on the city. Too many changes had occurred, too many functions were lost to the city area. New public buildings were built outside the city grid creating an environment with out any links to the past and further deplet- ing the functions of the city. The World Trade Centre and Convention Centre, lo- cated beyond Spencer Street, have vast public spaces which are often empty. A greater loss to the functions of the city was the removal of the art gallery to a location with the Performing Arts Centre in St Kilda Road. The museum is also soon to be moved from its city site. Freeway development brought more cars into the city of Melbourne. In early 1991, in response to surveys which showed that only 30 per cent of car traffic stopped in the city, the decision was made to create a pedestrian concourse of Swanson Street, to be duplicated later in Elizabeth Street. The city planners hope that by creating a car-free environment they will encourage people back to revitalise the city centre. The concept is a joint city and transport strategy made possible by the completion of the underground rail system and upgrad- ing other forms of public transport. With the removal of many functions from the city centre the new concourse will be a retail precinct. MAJOR development in the city of Sydney began in the 1820s. The sim- plified Georgian architectural style of con- vict Francis Greenway paved the way for future generations of architects to design in similar spare architectural styles. In the 1970s when the development push, which saw many of the old commer- cial buildings demolished, extended to the row houses at Woolloomooloo the building unions imposed green bans to save this historic site. The green bans were success- ful and the houses saved. This same spirit also preserved Sydney's public buildings, which were either added to, to meet present requirements in the case of the Art Gallery of NSW and the Sydney Hospital in Macquarie Street, or integrated into the cultural-heritage layer of the city. The Customs building on the quay was remodelled to house the Power Institute's contemporary art collection, a decorative arts museum was located in the Mint and the Hyde Park Barracks now house the Museum of Origin. The historic buildings located through out the central city maintain the tension between tradition and progress, and create a sense of power and meaning beyond the minutiae of daily life. The vitality of the city is maintained as visitors and residents are drawn to participate in the city as muse- um and workplace. Sydney addressed the problem of public transport and public access to the street in the 1920s when the population of Sydney reached one million. The first underground rail stations opened in 1926, and Martin Place was created as a pedestrian con- course. Through traffic was handled by an immense freeway. Seen to be destructive of the city environment, it was decided to meet further traffic needs by constructing a tunnel. Against the backdrop of the city the new Darling Harbour complex provides several kilometres of pedestrian concourse linking eating malls, restaurants, convention and exhibition centre, tourist and outdoor en- tertainment facilities. Its separation from the city by water allows space for a visual link between city and concourse so that each is revitalised by the other. THE CITY of Canberra was planned by Burley Griffin in 1912. The street plan was proposed for gazettal in 1918, but for nearly 30 years much of the form the new city would take was defined by plantations of trees. Comprehensive development did not begin till the 1950s and 1960s when Lake Burley Griffin was filled and the de- velopment of Woden began. Griffin determined three primary func- tions for the city. Three separate and equal sites were allocated for: the Australian Par- liament, the civic centre, and the historic function of a city as a marketplace. Located at the apexes of a triangle, each was linked by avenues. The central triangle was bisected by a broad concourse, which was divided into two separate functional areas by a lake. Parliament and govern- ment offices were located on one side, and across the water, museums, art galleries, theatres, entertainment centres and sport ing venues lined the bank of the lake and the concourse. World events overtook Griffin's plan- ning. World War I both used up the energy and resources necessary to construct the capital, and gave us a new image of our- selves, providing the deeds of heroism on which myths and legends are based. The spirit of Australians, then identified, was incorporated into the central con- course, and the War Memorial and Anzac Parade replaced the museums and enter- tainment facilities, across the water from the Parliament. The market centre located at an apex of the triangle was replaced by the Russell Hill defence establishments. In time the new Parliament House was built. The central triangle and concourse remained as Griffin had planned but the functions and locations of buildings changed. New buildings were sited to re- flect the evolving perception of the Austra lian nation, and the vision of the city centre as a landscape environment. FROM a brief look at the cities of Mel- bourne and Sydney it can be seen that a city depends on functions for its vitality. If many functions are removed from the city centre then the vitality of the city is diminished. Griffin stated that his plan for Canberra was first and foremost one of functions. Inevitably changes have been made to Griffin's plan for the central city area; on balance have we retained the viability of the city centre? In adjusting Griffin's plan to meet our evolving needs, have we given thought to the question Griffin regarded as fundamental to the city plan? The ""golden mile"" in Melbourne, Syd- ney's Sydney Cove and Canberra's triangle, are fragile environments. They convey a message to all of us about ourselves, our past, our present and our future. In each case the central area remains clearly de- fined although the city extends into further development, suburban precincts and sat- ellite cities. &nbsp; The belief held by the ""modern move- ment"" that a new city would evolve which displayed the technology of the 21st centu- ry has given way to the recognition that cities depend for their vitality on people. The city of Melbourne is engaged in the development of a major pedestrian con- course to bring people back to the city centre. Sydney has just completed a similar project. Griffin designed the central trian- gle of the city around a broad concourse. Whether the city was designed, as is the case with Melbourne and Canberra, or grew from a convict settlement as Sydney did, each city's plan is fundamental to the spirit of the city. Canberra is a city still in the making, and it is time to ask, what are the principles which hold the concept of our city togeth- er? It is not enough to look only to our own planning achievements. The influences on Griffin in the years up to 1912 when he designed Canberra are fundamental to our ability to interpret our city plan, and to make changes to our city, without the risk of losing the qualities that make Canberra, the successful city it is, worthy of change. Merilyn Evans is a long-time resident of Canberra with a particular concern for residents' participa- tion in the city's development."	"late 1970s in Swanson Street , a grey block con- struction , was expected to right the wrong that had fallen on the city . Too many changes had occurred , too many functions were lost to the city area . New public buildings were built outside the city grid creating anenvironmentwith out any links to the past and further deplet- ing the functions of the city .

Peter Bowler's review of Edmund. White's The Burning Li brary (CT, September 3, pCll) tells ""us little about the book but much about Mr Bowler's antipa thy towards homosexuality. . The review's opening sentence tells us that gay authors produce the best literature when they elide themselves so completely from their work that the reader has no idea of their sexuality. Since when have the best black writers been those who ignore their Aboriginal ly? Since when have the best fe male writers been those who fail to tell their readers they are wom en? I expect genuine reviews from The Canberra Times, not homo phobia tarted up as literary criti cism. 1 also expect an editorial policy that treats anti-homosexual tripe- from journalists as being as unacceptable as racism or misogy ny.

GEOFF BRADBURY Theodore No brawl at the ACFOA meeting YOUR front-page story ""Aid groups in brawl on ethics and me dia"" is a gross distortion of the discussion at the annual meeting of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) and sim ply reflects the fact that your re porter was not present (CT, Sep tember 12). The Canberra Times may well wish to examine the eth ics of running a front-page story on a meeting where it was not present and the only direct quotes are the inaccurate and out-of-con text ones attributed to me. There was no ""brawl"" or ""heat ed debate"" at the council meeting but rather a valuable, positive and creative discussion amongst the member agencies of ACFOA on how to increase accountability and collectively strengthen ethical stan dards. ACFOA members sign a man datory code of ethics and the council elects members of an eth ics committee to hear any com plaints on eihical issues. We have a long-standing and effective pro cedure to maintain ethical stan dards amongst ACFOA's 93 mem ber agencies. It is right and proper that the annual meeting discuss ethical and accountability issues that arise. The members of ACFOA are committed to full accountability for public funds and hope that the Industry Commission Inquiry into Charities will make strong recom mendations to see that outdated, inadequate and inconsistent state charity laws are reviewed. ACFOA's members have raised around half of the S26 million the public gave for Rwanda. We have welcomed the media's strong inter est in Rwanda which led to the public giving so magnificently. What we deeply regret, is that the media loses interest so quickly and, consequently funds for the return home, for rehabilitation ' and for longer-term development are so hard to raise. The media's response in the wake of the Somalia crisis was equally welcome but today when Somalia has slipped back to a sit uation of anarchy not dissimilar to that of 12 months ago, there is little media interest and great dif ficulty in raising funds to assist * the poor in Somalia. The serious discussions at the ACFOA council occurred in a non-adversarial atmosphere. Your report has distorted the reality of these discussions, which we deeply regret.

Tilt train the way to go IN YOUR July 21 issue you. published a letter from Ms Bet tie McNee which claimed a number of advantages for Speedrail. As I have written previously . in these pages. Speedrail is a company without significant funds whose directors arc Mr and Mrs Dale Budd. Mr Budd is a Canberra lobbyist who op erates out of a lobbying com pany called AC1L Economics and Policy Pty Ltd. Speedrail has conducted no environmental-impact study nor has it yet conducted any finan ; cial feasibility study. The list of claims which Ms McNee makes for Speedrail about its financial and environmental advantages are therefore entirely without substance. ' I freely admit that I first bc .came interested in the VFT and ' more recently in Speedrail be cause its proposed route would go through my property at Sut ton Forest and thus make my home uninhabitable and destroy the value of my property. In a telephone conversation some months ago, Mr Budd asked me if I would cease my opposition to Speedrail if the route was altered to go through someone else's property instead of mine. I replied that the envi ronmental problems of Speed rail combined with the need to forcibly seize land from hun dreds of private-property own ers and the lack of any finan cial evidence to . support its viability would compel me to continue to oppose this project even if its route had no impact on me, personally. T' fully support the idea of modernising our rail system and 1 believe that the tilt train would provide an affordable modernisation without addition al major environmental prob lems, without the need to re sume private land and at a cost which would be much more ac ceptable than Speedrail. The cost to upgrade the exist ing track for the tilt train would be between SI00 and $200 million, whereas the cost of Speedrail would be S2.4 bil lion for the Sydney-Canberra link only. Given that Speedrail would only be about 45 minutes faster than a tilt train to Canberra, it is inconceivable that the addi tional S2.2 billion involved with Specdrail could provide a viable financial return. I believe the Speedrail vs tilt train argument should be con ducted impartially by a group consisting of representatives from the government, the rail organisations, representatives of ordinary citizens and of farmers and any other interested parties. I have two questions, one di rected to Ms McNee and one to Speedrail. 1. Is Ms McNee employed by Speedrail or by ACIL or is she a friend or acquaintance of Mr Budd or of anyone employed by Speedrail, ACIL or a related party? 2. Speedrail is reported to be contributing S250,000 towards the proposed financial feasibility study to which the Federal and ACT Governments are also contributing. But Speedrail's contribution is ""in cash and in kind"". How much cash is Specdrail contributing and how much is by way of ""services"". And are any of those services being provided by ACIL or re lated parties? MICHAEL BALL Sutton Forrest, NSW"	"Letters to the Editor New name for Which Bank ?

I -SL believe there were enough good decisions made in the prc-scason compe tition by in-goal touch judges to say that it [the trial] should be kept in. ""No one asked mc as a coach whether I felt it was a good thing after the fact, I agreed early in the piece that I thought it v. was."" Those were the words of Canberra Raiders coach Tim Sheens in an Inside Interview in last week's edition of the Rugby League Times. Three days later anyone who saw the performance of ref eree Graham Anncslcy in the Manly verses Brisbane game was saying the same thing. If it had been a basketball game the ""slam dunk"" by Broncos hooker Kerrod Walters would have been worthy of gain ing a win for his team. But for such a blatant bounce to be awarded as a rugby league try appears to be almost beyond belief. If there is any shred of doubt in a referees mind then a try should not be awarded. And the one way to ensure a referee doesn't not make an inadvertent ' but extremely costly mistake is through the introduction of in goal touch judges. The dropping of Anncsley to reserve grade docs nothing for the referee and does not give Manly back the two com petition points. It appears that Annes ley's view may have been obscured by the body of Manly's Ian Roberts — al though why he didn't seek an opinion from the touch judge remains a mystery. Anneslcy is a human being and human • beings make mistakes. It is part of the nature of rugby league that it is a game played by 26 humans and controlled by one human, with the help of two others (although many ""get 'em on side"" • screamers would no doubt argue about that). The balancc to the old-time argue ment about human error being part of the game is that there is now so much money tied up in the sport, every incor rect decision has ramifications far be yond the awarding of two competition points. ^ A club which happens to be unlucky enough to be on the wrong end of two or three game-deciding decisions could miss out on the final five. That in turn effect the marketability of the club in these days of hardship in attracting corporate sponsors. Being out side the five also effects the size of crowds, thus gate takings, and makes it difficult to attract players who, given a., choice between a successful or borderline ' club, usually go to the one where they are likely to win a premiership. And that's why, unfortunately in many ways, the time has come for in goal touch judges. Now Inoticc that NSW Rugby League chairman Ken Arthurson has suddenly had a change of heart and supported the move. Let's hope it happens sooner rath er than later and that, in the meantime, referees are not hung for being humans, despite how angry their decisions make the football watching public. The NSWRL originally opposed the idea, saying it would not be possible to supply enough experienced officials for all games at all levels. I agree — but the obvious solution is to apply the rule only to the Winfield Cup. It is the elite competition and the only one in Australia on which so much mon ey and prestige hinges. In a day of foot ball nine officials are on hand to control the three grade games. All that needs to happen is for the officials to be rotated. There is no reason why, for example, for the touch judges in the under-21s cannot sit in chairs at ei ther end of the field in first grade. Maybe the NSWRL should think about giving the officials a substantial pay rise for their troubles, a suggestion also made by Sheens last week. Then maybe we would get more people inter ested tn taking up what is no doubt an • extremely thankless task."	"Manly back the two com petition points .

Professor Murdoch., in the form ' of answers, to. readers' questions, will discuss subjects ? of political, social', and philosophical interest. that in the seemingly heartless world there is a heart of human pity. It is worth 1 aving an illness to be reminded of that core of goodness in our civilisation. Well, coming back to thc fine senti- ments with, which 1 started,1 I wanted to justify my survival by doing some- thing really useful, such as answering an urgent question from some per- plexed reader, and helping him to solve one of the many problems, of existence. 1 open my cardboard box, take out the question that lies on the top of the bundle, and read-the abovel Fate seems to be in one of its ironical moods. It is making a mo ? of my aspirations after, useful- ness. 1 didn't know there were any coal formations in the polar regic.is; and if there are, 1 don't in the least know how they got lhere. . . This is a shameful confession : d,f ignorance; what is more shameful still is that I am not a bit ashamed of it..' There arc some things that 1 am perfectly content not to know. The fact is that every.human mind is a storehouse of facts mostly use- less. That eminently modern in- vention the radio quiz brings á num- ber of persons together and tests their memories to discover which of them remembers the greatest number of entirely useless facts. For my part I listen to these com- petitions with wonder, but without any envy whatever: being mindful bf Whitehead's saying that ""a merely well-informed man is the most use- less bore on God's earth."" Thc intelligent person, it seems to mc, is thc person who knows how to forget scraps of information, to clear his mind of useless lumber and leave room for the free play of the mind. If I knew the cause of coal formation in the polar region 1 should do my best to forget it. All the same, I am sorry to bc so unhelpful to a reader who for some inscrutable rea- son hungers for information on this matter. He must ask a geologist. , Which is Dispensed in our Law Courts, Justice or Law? .TVHE first function of a law court is historical research. In a murder trial, for instance, the 12 good men and true in thc jury box become for the time being students of history. They are not con- cerned with what is just or what is ' unjust. They are. concerned only with historical facts; did the ac- cused commit thc crime with which he is charged or did he not? This is an historical inquiry, just as if they were inquiring into the doings af Oliver Cromwell. (In Cromwell's case thc jury has never yet been able to agree.) . When the jury has agreed about thc historical facts it is for the Judge to assume that the jury is a sound historian no matter what his per- sonal opinion may bc, and then to pass sentence according lo the law of thc land no matter what he. may think of thc law. He may in fact believe the law to be thoroughly un- just. In one of G. K. Chesterton's early stories a very great Judge is supposed to have gone mad when he says to a man convicted of a crime of pas- sion: ""I sentence you to three years' imprisonment under the firm and solemn and God-given conviction that what you require is three months at thc seaside;"" ', . ' A recent'"" American , book, half novel'half fantasy, presents a picture of a Judge who is ""a rebel against the decree that, makes him .an.'ad-' ministrátor of the law when what humanity heeds is a dispenser of justice, He knows-as what honest and intelligent Judge does not?-that law is by its very nature mechanical, and it revolts him to see flesh and spirit delivered to mechanical forces. So his profession becomes his- cruci- fixion."" The author of this book is himself a Judge and his book is a passionate protest against ""the fate that summons a man to act like God with only human faculties."" My answer to your question is that a law court is thc imperfect instru- ment devised to forward the ends of ideal justice; but it is not concerned with justice. Thc Judge is there to administer the law as it is, not as he may think it ought to bc. He is in the posi- tion of Tennyson's soldier: ""His. not to reason why."" . The people who are concerned with justice are the people who make the laws-our legislators, not our Judges. Of course I don't deny that á Judge may and often does go outside his province to prevent a flagrant in- justice; or the reverse. lt was a Judge, for instance,' who was responsible in the famous Sacco Vanzetti case for sending to thc elec- tric chair two men who, as everyone now admits, were perfectly innocent of thc crime with which they were charged. But men of the type of Judge Thayer are, fortunately, ex- ceptions in the civilised world. As a general' rulc.it is not the law court, but the law, that is to blame for a miscarriage of justice. Why is the First of January Called ¡Sew Year's Day? T DON'T know when, or by whom, it was decided that each year should end on December 31 and a new one start on January 1. To children, and to adults with childish"" minds, I suppose it seems a part of the nature of things; but of course it isn't. It is a matter of arbitrary choice. During the French Revolution the authorities of Paris decided that the first day of the year should hence- forward be September . 21, and the new calendar, as far' as I know, worked as well as thc old. The earth swings round thc sun in approximately 365 days; why should we choose a particular spot in space and say that every time the earth reaches that spot a new year begins? Any other spot would do just as well, so long as we all agreed about it. The stream of time flows equably and continuously forward 'without a moment's pause: it is we mortals who have got into the way of dividing it into years and centuries, as if there were sharp lines cut across it, and as if a year were a concrete thing, and a century a larger thing with a colour of its own. Have you never reflected that every day is the first of a new year, and every'sunrise the dawn of a- new century? That thc old year should be held to die'at midnight on December 31 is not Nature's doing: it is a human arrangement, quite a convenient one. Time needs these punctuation marks. This one-a semi-colon we may call it; not a full stop-there are no full stops in time-is a reminder, once in 365 days, to take stock of thc past, to make good resolutions for the future, and to wish one another hap- piness for the next 365 days. On Christmas Day wc also ex- change good wishes, butoir benevo- lence extends to one, day only: ""A merry Christmas,"" we say. On New Year's Day we venture a little farther afield, and wish one another a whole new year of happiness. Farther than a year we don't dare to go; at the end of 1900 wc didn't, as far as I can remember, wish one another ""A happy New Century."" Have I answered your question'.' There is no reason in the nature of things why the year should be divided -into months. It is merely a conven- tion. The essential thing is that every- body, or at least the majority of.man- kind, should agree about it. . I was in France in 1934; but when 1 crossed the frontier into Italy I found that I was no longer living in 1934; I was in the year 12, the Italian authorities having decided that time began with Mussolini's celebrated ""March on Rome."" They were quite within their rights, of course; but it was a little bewilder- ing for the Italians themselves when you asked them the date of Julius Caesar's crossing, of the Rubicon. The study of history at schools would be vastly complicated if we . didn't agree about dates-if there were, no generally accepted meaning in 1066 and all that. This is a matter on which the most unconventional of us had better accept the convention and agree lo call this year 1947 A.D."

Government committees and departments, and Canberra Tour ism, have been working behind the scenes to exploit the parks and reserves with commercial wilderness chalets, farm-based ac commodation and an emphasis on activities such as white-water rafting, abseiling, bushwalking, caving, orienteering and horse riding. New and better roads and facil ities would be built adjacent to Namadgi National Park, at Tid binbilla Nature Reserve, Can berra Nature Park, Googong Dam and the Jerrabomberra Wetlands. The national capitaljvould then be able to compete for a two-mil lion strong ecotourism market with Tasmania, the Northern Ter ritory and Queensland. The research is based largely^ on a report — A Question of Bal ance — written by former tour ism commissioner David Lawr ance last, year and which puts forward wide-ranging recom mendations to develop nature parks and bushlands in an envi ronmentally sensitive manner for nature-based tourism. The report, completed in Octo ber, 1994, calls for a: • four-star chalet and confer ence facilities at Tidbinbilla; • two-star hostel along Tidbin billa Nature Drive; • exclusive five-star chalet at Googong, like the Lake Cracken back Resort; • good-quality, short-stay cara van park below Googong Dam but within the foreshores reserve; • high-country guest house near the Visitor Information Cen tre outside Namadgi National Park; • cafes at Tidbinbilla and Na madgi, and eventually Googong Dam, Pine Island and Jerrabom berra Wetlands. Some costs could be met by charging entry fees for Tidbinbil la, Namadgi and Googong; from concession fees to retailers and A panoramic view across the Tidbinbilla Ranges, one attraction expected to appeal to nature-loving tourists. food outlets; camping fees on camp sites using pre-paid vouch ers; boat registration fees; distinc tive conservation number plates and upgrading the Jerrabomberra Wetlands Interpretation Centre. There would be a strong em phasis on water sports with a sports-fishing industry, funded by annual park-usage permits, an aquatic viewing area from which to see spawning beds, platypuses, water rats and other fauna and catch-and-release angling. Goo gong Dam should be re-named Lake Googong and commercial operators invited to operate a cruise vessel there. Other proposals include a walk-through aviary at Tidbinbil la, ranger-guided walking tours, and a horse-trail network and a major running event in Stromlo Forest. The Government should exam ine holding Australia's first regu lar electric outboard boating event to be directed by the ACT the National Capital Planning Au thority and the scientific commu nity of Canberra. Mr Lawrance said one of his main reasons for promoting eco tourism was that the ACT had not achieved its potential in na ture-based tourism compared with the rest of the nation.

Eight Army air defence specialists will join the support ship, HMAS Success, in Fremantle to help protect the lightly armed ship. Mr Hawke ruled out any army involvement on Monday saying, ""We are not sending any troops to the Middle East."" The eight soldiers will man a number of Army RBS70 low level air defence weapons, a shoulder-fired laser-guided system. The Success, which is going to the Gulf as the supply ship for the guided missile frigates HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Darwin, is equipped with 340 millimetre Bofors guns and other stan dard air defence machine guns. Although the Success would normally be expected to stay outside danger areas, the Government decided it needed the extra protection of the air defence spe cialists. The eight soldiers are from the 16th Air Defence Unit, based at Wood side in the Adelaide Hills. Meantime, the Government yesterday acknowledged the danger of the opera tion by boosting the servicemens' pay by $45 a day while they are in the operation al area and exempting their wages from taxation. Approved by Cabinet yesterday, the Minister for Defence Science and Per sonnel, Gordon Bilncy, said the benefits are ""commensurate with the dangerous nature of this deployment"". ""We've struck a special Gulf Allow ance, similar to the allowance that was paid to the troops we sent to Namibia, we've given exemption from taxation as the Prime Minister promised, we've also said that they'll qualify, without waiting the normal six years, for defence home loans and we've guaranteed them the other benefits that go with operational service,"" Mr Bilncy said. While Cabinet yesterday rubber stamped Mr Hawke's decision to deploy the ships, the groundswell of opposition within the ALP appears to be growing. The left-wing of the party yesterday promised to oppose the move in Caucus next week with some sources suggesting the three-ship fleet be held in Fremantle until such a time the United Nations decidcs to endorse a multinational force to man the blockade. As well, the NSW branch of the Young Labor movement yesterday promised to urge other state delegates to condemn Mr Hawke over the decision to send Austral ians to the Middle East. Branch Presid ent, Carmel Tebbutt said that Mr Hawke's actions ""contradict all the val ues the ALP stands for"". ""Our involve ment serves only to put Australians at risk and to add credibility to the milita rism of the US,"" Ms Tebbutt said.

Rapid Soil Erosion., (D. M. REGAN.) Whether from sheer Ignorance, or from purblind obstinacy coupled with political laissez faire, we are preparing for posterity a legacy which will ever stand starkly as a monument to the passing of Australia's fertile lands. Unheeded and unheeding, day by day tho burden of this legaoy, Increasing Its bulk by that which It feeds upon, grows more voraci- ous and Inexorable, Is the spreading cancer- ous mass of desert in our ""Dead Centre of Australia,"" Dust storms, forerunners of the desert, are becoming more and more frequent over areas where they have in the past been regarded as an unpleasant and rare visitation. The ""Bodourles"" (dust storms) of Western Queensland, so named because of their preva- lence in. the district of that township, no longer confino themselves to the pastoral landa of (that State, but sweep across in one devastating"" and unbroken pall from the Northern Territory to the Queensland coast and far out to sea. The area of land enjoying comparative Immunity appears to be enclosed by a strip taken right around the coast, with the excep- tion of portions of Western Australia. The soil-condition of this area varies but little from year to year, due to the fact that the rainfall is such as to maintain sufficient growth to keep the position more or less static. It is often conceived that the prime cause of erosion Iles with the soil itself. This is not so, except in rare Instances, and the following point may well serve to substantiate this contention. Towards the centre of Aus- tralia Ile the Depot Sandhills, as barren as they are renowned throughout the history of overland travel, I have seen this country and other areas similar In formation as a red-brown, sun-scorched desert. Twenty-four hours after a good fall of rain the first shoots of a thin, light grass appear. Within three days the desert has become invested with a sparse carpet of green. This is the eight-day grass, as It la known locally, and it actually germinates, grows to full maturity and dies within that time. On yet another occasion, and in country of vastly different formation, I saw a haid, glittering area of clay-pan transformed Into a garden that would grow anything my limited horticultural knowledge could missest Tomatoes for Instance, bore throughout the whole year and melons, and the full range of tubers matured quicker than I bad ever been aware of before. This was ninety miles west of Alice Springs, which is supposed to be the true centre of the con- tinent, and the garden was watered from a well sunk in the middle of it, a 25ft shaft tapping a supply of up to 8000 gallons of excellent water. Lacking as Australia is In any considerable network of Interior waterways, limitless areas of land must rely to a very large extent for their rainfall upon that residue of moisture evaporated from the sea and not condensed over the coastal belt, to which It has been carried by prevailing winds. Though America finds herself with a weighty soil-erosion prob- lem of her own, it Is safe to say that Aus- tralia, with the Interior waterways of the Mississippi Basin, would find the moisture from such cn evaporation area more than sufficient to hold in check the encroachment of the desert and turn to profitable account the arid wastes of the present Dead Centre. TRACKS OF OCEAN. Little doubt seems to exist that at one period an Inland sea of some magnitude ex- tended through from the cast of Western Australia to the south-west of Queensland and the north-west of New South Wales, covering also what is now the north of South Australia. I have personally collected fossils over 1000 miles from the nearest coastline, which, palaeontologists agree, arc to be found In the south of South Australia. Taking into consideration the facts of a geo-physlcal sur- vey of this erstwhile submarine area, I am of the belief that the inland sea, of which Lake Eyre and Lake Amadeus appear to be the only remaining relics, ultimately emptied Itself through the Great Rift Valley of South Aus- tralia. The Rift extends northwards, having the two gulfs, Spencer's and St. Vincent's, at Its southern end. This debouchment may account to some extent for the fact that the most fertile soils are found in the* vicinity of tho gulf area. ' ' It is more than probable that further uptbrusts and subsidences closed the Rift Valley connection with the sea, and that tho climatic conditions then prevailing drove off the remaining volume of water which ultimately receded to the shallow Lake Eyre in its far-flung sandy basin. A prominent Australian writer, In contri- buting to a Sydney paper some months ago, stresses deservedly the need for active resis- tance against eroding soil, but embraces the misfortune, In so doing, of suggesting a remedy which Is at the outset wholly Imprac- ticable, The plan throughout seeks to combat effect without firstly attacking cause, and Is, In short, a scheme for scattering broadcast over vast areas of wasteland the seeds of some plant life capable of withstanding the rigours of climatic conditions. With due deference to such a stimulating proposal as the use of an aeroplane with which to undertake this work, I cannot even then conceive that the ultimate reclamation of Australia's vanishing pastoral lands will be found in the results ni a campaign such as this. The most vltnl problem Is, not the Introduction of plant life itself, but of the wherewithal to sustain It; and until It becomes possible to Induce an adequate rainfall over stricken arcas, the matter of plant life scarcely becomes relevant. In sardonic testimony to the vastly dif- ferent nature of bygone climatic eras is the Finke ""River,"" now only visible as a dry sinuous watercourse infrequently dotted with small, shallow waterholes. At no time with- in the memory of man has there been a flow of water throughout Its whole length for a period of any duration, though raro flows of post years have raced down from the head- waters and lost themselves in the thirsty throat of the desert. From the nature of that portion of the river bed which has re- mained in its original position, it can be deduced that at some remote period the rain- fall must have been such as to have ensured the stream being kept In constant flow. Tow- ering gorges cut by water out of solid lock cannot be credited to a sticam which is only such because the Government Map Depart- ment had the temerity to say so. And, as the physical features of the surrounding coun- try do not Indicate that this area wa3 a catch- ment for the Finke, it Is surmised that the rainfall must have been extraordinarily heavy. A possible link with a later, and again dif- ferent period Is found in a cluster of palm trees growing around the bed of the rlvsr at an Isolated point whero the position of the river bed has remained unchanged. Though I have no definite botanical authority for expressing this beliol, I sra of ths opinion that palms of a dmilfv ¡¡pccioi c»nnol be traced rlsewhcra In (OB wlrJ. while a geo- physical survey of those intend neta ta they are to-day definitely pi oves tiiat there IA not the remotest chance of any recurrence of the heavy rainfall eras under existing condi- tions, it is only natural to assume that arti- ficially induced rainfall will not 1M possible until such a time when a large body of water can be flowed In from the ocean to cover the bed of the long-since-vanished in- land sea. This probably extended from the southern end of the Macdonnell Ranges to Quorn, S.A. Coward Springs, north of Quorn, Is on the inside edge of tho old seabed, and readings taken In this district show that the depth below sea-level varies from sixteen to twenty feet. STEADY ENCROACHMENT. Granting the reconstruction of this inland sea to something or its former proportions, there can be but little doubt that the rain- fall consequent upon local evaporation and condensation would transform hundreds of thousands of square milc3 of practically use- less territory, and In sustaining the growth of vegetation prove Itself the most potent fac- tor in the battle against erosion. The con- stant shifting of sands, though often more apparent as a local symptom, cannot be Ignored as the slow-strangling tentacles of that voracious decapod, the desert. Grass- lands of the eastern coast are becoming pow- dered with this fine inland sand-germs from the cancerous growth spreading from the Dead centre. Dustorms obscure the sky and even shower their red rain far out upon the sea; and still nothing is realised but the passing inconvenience and the personal dis- comfort. I can visualise only one remedy. An ex- pensive one, but what a form of national in- surance! Recreate the climate and rainfall as they were In the days when the Finke River ran swiftly from its source to the in- land sea which has almost vanished. By the concentration of our engineering brains and ability let us devise the means for flooding those vast arid tracts of our inland wastes with water from the coastline of South Aus- tralia. I have yet to bo convinced that ' such a scheme Is not practicable."

The twenty-second annual exhibition of the Art Society has been opened formally by Rear-Admiral Beaumont.

When our artists learn to trust themselves, to see and observe for themselves, and to acquire a craftsman's facility in put- ting the results of their observation on canvas, we may expect much better exhibi- tions. It is not in ambitious subjects that success is necessarily won, but in the con- scientious and thoughtful study of the familiar.

(BY ""OUR' SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE) . WOONONA, Friday.-At the seventh annual conference of the Illawarra district branches of the 'Agricultural Bureau to-day, the presi- dent (Mi. A. C. Brown) said that the confer- ence was being held at Woonona in recognition of the splendid work the local branch was do- ing, and the fact that it possessed the larg- est membership of any branch in the State. A welcome to delegates was extended by the President of the Bulli Shire (Councillor F. Morrison), who said that the long dis- tance many of them had travelled was typi- cal of the enthusiasm shown by members of the bureau. The competition resulting from bureau exhibits at local shows had done much to raise the standard of the exhibitions as a whole. I I The value of the bureau movement in en- couraging and spreading better methods of farming was emphasised by Mr. A. H. E. Mc- Donald, Director of Agriculture, who declared that farmers had had to reah.se during recent years the necessity for making their proper- ties more self-supporting and less specialised, by the development of sidelines. This tran- sition had been greatly assisted by the bureau organisation. The three important principles promulgated by the Agricultural Bureau were better farm- ing, better business management, and better household conditions, said Mr. W. W. Wat- son, the general president, in officially open- ing the conference. It was essential, he said, that the average production should be raised to the high levels attained by the win- ners in the Royal Agricultural Society's com- I petitions. The Farmers' Relief Bill now be- fore Parliament showed that the strain on the farmer of late years had been too great. The difficult times had made many changes necpssary. Outstanding perhaps was the development of dairying in the western wheat districts. In his presidential report, Mr. A. C. Brown stated that the difficulties of the past few years had necessitated more concentration on economic production. The Department of Agriculture, by fostering a spirit of investi- gation amongst primary producers, had en- abled this to be achieved. A personal ser- vice of instruction conducted through the branches of the bureau had been of the greatest practical value. Mr. Brown then outlined the wide field of activities covered by various branches of the movement In the district, and appealed for a still more vigorous co-operation to forward the important work carried out. Mr. P. Turnbull (Woonona), in moving that conference urge for the appointment of an orchard Inspector for the district, including Kiama, Albion Park, Cordeaux River, to Helensburgh, said that the livings of many or chardists in that zone had been Jeopardised by insect pests. This was agreed to. A motion from the Exeter branch to the effect that departmental officers organise their tours systematically from bureau to bureau to eliminate unnecessary expense, was also car- ried. PLANT PROPAGATION. The main factors to be studied in suc- cessful plant propagation were the nature of. the plant grown, the soil and the seasonal conditions, said Mr. R. N. Makin, senior agricultural instructor. To force growth under out of season conditions hot-beds were used to germinate the seed. The heat of these should be reduced to 80 degrees Fahrenheit before sowing the seed. The beds should be well screened from wind, frost, and at times the sun. To harden off the plants a cold frame was very useful. With melon, pumpkin, and cucumber crops forcing methods might result In a dim- inution of trouble from insect pests. To facili- tate this, Mr. Makin advocated the use of small galvanised Iron cartons to contain the compost and seed. By removing the detachable strips the plants could be removed to their outdoor position without damage to the roots. In an address entitled ""Diseases of Cattle,"" Mr, Veech, B.V.Sc, comprehensively surveyed the more Important diseases of stock, their economic importance, and control. The lec- ture was supplemented by exhibits of various organs of normal and abnormal animals. MARKETING PROBLEMS. Whilst much progress had been made In increasing the carrying capacity of land the farmer seemed tethered to an antiquated method of selling, said Mr. H. J. Bakewell, of MU George, a member of the advisory council. Returns for the sale of stock weie fated with as much uncertainty as the results of a State lottery. The organisation of the milk industry was deserving of praise. The board had en- sured a better return for the dalry farmer without increasing the price of the milk to the consumer. Overhead expenses In some marketing boards, however, had been too heavy. Honey producers were not satisfied with their board, and, therefore, dispensed with it. The manner in which they had got together to formulate some more satisfactory scheme of selling their produce was to be highly com- mended. All producers would eventually have to band together In order to have a bigger say In the selling of their goods. On the motion of Mr. A. C. Brown (Exeter), it was resolved to ask the Department of Edu- cation to Inaugurate courses in agiiculture in all primary and High schools, giving practical Instruction where possible, and also to extend the correspondence courses.

Justification of the rejection of the Emer- gency Income Tax Bill was expressed in the Legislative Council last night during the de- bate on a motion submitted by Mr Boyce The object of the motion was to affirm that the House should assert its right, and its duty as a part of the Legislature. It was contended by Mr. Boyce that the majority of the public was solidly behind the Upper House. The Vice-President of the Executive Coun- cil (Mr. Concannon), who is leader of the Government in the Upper House, made the first Ministerial declaration in Parliament since the debate on the attitude of the Upper House to the Government's legislation opened on Tuesday. The Government, he said, demanded the right of the Legislative Assembly to control the public purse. By its legislation the Go- vernment was endeavouring to balance the Budget and solve unemployment. The motton, he declared, had been framed in a spirit of party bitterness and political blas. THE MOTION. Directly the Legislative Council met Mr. Boyce moved the adjournment of the House to consider the following motion: ""(1) That this House asserts Its right and , its duty as a part of the Legislature of New South Wales, composed of representatives of all classes and Interests, to protect the people of New South Wales against an abuse of power, to reject or amend those measures which have not been approved by the elec- tors, and which it regards as disastrous to the State and the Commonwealth, and to In- quire into the probable effects of those which have not been the subject of adequate investi- gation, and of which no reasonable discussion has been permitted. ""(2) That these principles wore applied by this House in dealing with the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the Re- duction of Interest Bill, and the Emergency Income Tax Bill. ""(3) That the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Bill contains provisions which went far beyond the policy announced by the Premier at the recent general election, and which required careful investigation, that no adequate discussion of tile bill in the Legis- lative Assembly had been permitted and that for the purpose of obtaining necessary infor- mation this House referred the bill to a select committee, which has carried on its investi- gations with the utmost despatch. That the ' Reduction of Interest Bill was contrary to a specific pledge against repudiation given to the electors by the Premier at the recent general election, and to the policy then enun- ciated. That the Emergency Income Tax Bill, besides being opposed to that policy, would have frustrated or destroyed the plan devised by all the Governments of the Com- monwealth for the rehabilitation of Australia. ""(4) That in its treatment of these and other measures this House has not encroached on the powers or responsibilities of the Legis- lative Assembly, but has exercised its consti- tutional right and duty of protecting the people of the State and of preventing the passago of legislation which has never been sanctioned by the electors and to which a large majority of the electors is believed to be opposed. ""(5) That under the bi-cameral system in force in New South Wales it is the right and duty of the Governor to exercise a discretion having regard to all the circumstances of the case, when asked to make appointments with a view to coercing the Legislative Council. ""That the president be requested to convey the foregoing resolution to his Excellency the Governor for transmission to the Secretary of State for the Dominions."" The motion declaring that the matter should be treated as one of urgency was carried by 33 to 9 and a motion providing for the sus- pension of the Standing Orders to permit of immediate consideration was agreed to by 34 to 10. Messrs. Coates, Malone, and L. W. Ryan voted with the majority on each division. ""In moving this motion,"" said Mr. Boyce, ""I propose to say very little. The Legis- lative Council needs no defence from me for anything that it has done, and I am satisfied that the great mass of the people of New South Wales stands solidly behind us. (Hear, , hear.) Nor do I think it a pioper occasion . to criticise the actions or discuss the func- tions of any officer of the State, however i highly placed. This motion states the facts as I believe them to be, and that being so, I ask the House to cany it."" MR. CONCANNON'S SPEECH. , The leader of the Government (Mr. Con- cannon) said that, with reference to the first clause of the motion it was a fact that the ""gag"" had been applied more by the recent Bavin Administration from 1927-30 than it had ever been applied by a Labour Administration. He could not conceive that any of the legislation introduced by the pres- ent Government was without the support of the electors. For instance, the matters con- tained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill formed one of the outstanding planks of the Labour movement. It was the responsibility of members of the Legislative Council to have given the Government the courtesy of at least a second reading and a free discussion in the committee stages. Those members who were permeated by hatred of the Labour movement took the business out of the hands of the Government and by a subterfuge rele- gated the bill to temporary, If not permanent, oblivion. Three months had passed by since the bill was sent to the committee, but no final report had been received. When the present Government took office in October last year it was confionted with a financial crisis of a magnitude that had never been ' faced before. Mr. Lang had said to the elec- tors, ""We will cure that act of repudiation by the Nationalist party and we shall balance the Budget."" In order to do that the Gov- ernment introduced the Emergency Income Tax Bill. By means of that bill it was intended that at June, 1932, the estimated deficit would be £1,000,000, and not as it was to-day, in the vicinity of £11,000,000. The ideas that permeated the Lang plan had been present in the minds of the greatest economists in the world for many years post. , Only by a reduction of interest could pros- perity be regained in both primary and secondary industries. The Interest Reduc- tion Bill was also taken out of the hands of the Government and by a resolution of a majority of the membeis of the House the second reading was deferred for six months. The principle of the reduction of Interest enunciated in the bill had received the en- \ dorsement of the Prime Minister and the whole of the Premiers of Australia. CONTROL OP PUBLIC PURSE. ""On October 25, 1930,"" proceeded Mr. , Concannon, ""a Labour Government was re- turned to power with the largest personnel of any previous Government. This Govern- ment still has a majority of the people behind it. Therefore, there is certainly no reason for the transmission of a message such as this from a nominee Chamber in New South Wales. I have no intention of endeavouring to debate the question of constitutional rights beyond saying that it has been recognised by popular usage and by invariable custom for ' many years that the control of the public purse should be retained by the representatives of the people elected on adult suffrage. This i crisis would not have occurred, possibly, on the rejection of a bill, were it not for such a vital and outstanding principle as that of control of the public purse. The Premier, in conformity with his election pledges, said to Parliament and to the people, 'We are i' endeavouring to balance the Budget; we are endeavouring to solve unemployment by \ absorbing the big army of unemployed by converting loan expenditure into wages.' The Premier may have been wrong. The majority of members of this House thought he was wrong."" Sir Allen Taylor: There is no doubt about it. , Mr. Concannon: I have considerable doubts, and so have many members who support me. The position Is that this constitutional crisis hno occurred because of the action of a noml- . nr Chamber which has been abolished by its own vote. (Cries of ""Oh, no1 Nothing of 1 the kind I"") ""I repeat it,"" proceeded Mr. Concannon. s Mr. Robson: They referred it to the electors. J Mr. Concannon: Two measures were Intro- "" duced Into this House some months ago. The ¿ fundamental object of one of them was the (j H wÄ.°tn.°l,tV,f House' and ll wajs Passed without a division.

The action of this House, m taking away the fundamental and Inherent rights of the popu- lar cnamber, however, is unDrecedentirl during the last 20 years. unpreceaenxea Mr. Boyce: Has the Government requested ÎL LfuÏTther appointments should be made to the Upper House? imM&lt;r-. Concannon: You have been a Cabinet Minister and know that Cabinet secrets must not be divulged. You will be told at the right time. He added that if there had been coercion surely the people possessed that right through the leaders of the elected Chamber, to pass legislation to secure money to carry on the necessary services of the State, and to absorb the unemployed in reproductive employment. MR. FARRAR'S SUPPORT. Mr. Farrar, supporting the motion, denied the suggestion that there had been undue delay on the Dart of the Select Committee which was Investigating the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The bill, he said, was received from the Legis- lative Assembly without any semblance of debate or due consideration by the elected representatives of the people. With regard to the proposed abolition of the Upper House, it had been decided that this should not take place without a referendum. ""Mr. Lang attended the Premiers' Confer- ence In Melbourne,"" proceeded Mr. Farrar, ""and agreed to a plan of rehabilitation for the whole of Australia. The financial ex- perts and the bankers, who were present, drew up schemes of finance for the next 12 months. Mr. Lang concurred, and signed the agreement. Naturally Parliament and the people of New South Wales were en- titled to expect that Mr. Lang would immediate- ly submit legislation covering the points of that agreement. Instead of that he brought down an Income Tax Amending Bill, contrary to tlie policy announced by him during the election campaign, ""I feel that this House, of which 1 have been a member for 20 years, has, during the past few weeks, carried out the high tradi- tions laid down by many members who have adorned this Chamber In the past, and has asked the Government to halt only till such time as the people, who are masters of the situation, have an opportunity of voicing their opinions on questions which were not contained in the policy speech delivered by Mr. Lang. On the contrary, the legislation submitted to the Assembly and to this House Is diametrically opposed in principle and in detail to any clause of that policy speech. Let the Government, having changed Its opinions since it obtained a mandate, again appeal to the people, definitely stating what it proposes to do, and when the great voice of the people has spoken this House will do nothing to thwart or destroy the expressed opinion of the people of this sovereign Btate."" ,_ , _, Mr. J. Ryan denied that there existed any hatred of the Labour movement. Contrary to what was claimed by Mr. Concannon, the Inter- est Reduction Bill was not a statesmanlike mea- sure, and It did not embody principles that had been accepted by the Melbourne Conference. The Council had no alternative to throwing It out. In doing so it did Its duty. ""LANG NIGHTMARE."" After directing attention to criticisms of the Government by Mr. Coates and Mr. Grayndler, Mr. Ryan said rather warmly: ""If every Labour representative showed the same independence of spirit and regard for the community as these men, the Lang nightmare would be terminated in 48 hours. I have lived here for more than 40 years, and I have not known of any man professing the desire to advance the Interests of the people who has done more harm to them than has this present Premier of New South Wales. No man who was born In this coun- try and no man who came to make his home here has done one-tenth of the harm that this man has done."" Mr. Wrench said that the resolution was the outcome of what had occurred in the Assembly. Members in the Council had been taught many things about their rights and duties, but it should be remembered by everyone who took an Interest in their country that the elected representatives of the people had rights also. He criticised the section of the motion which dealt with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and said that If members wanted an un- biassed opinion they might have obtained it from the Industrial Court rather than through the medium of a Select Committee. The Emergency Income Tax Bill was one of the measures that had been harshly treated by the Upper House. He was prepared to admit that it was not a perfect bill, out its weak points-If there were any-could have been rectified. The Constitution gave the Governor discretionary power. ""If I vote against that I am voting against the Constitution. How can I do that?"" he asked. Mr, Robson: Hear, hear! Well, vote the right way. Mr. Bryant said that every one who was a student of the history of the Legislative Council, and who had a knowledge of the bicameral system, must admit that the Upper Chamber was necessary to preserve the rights of the people. He spoke as one of the founders of the original political Labour party, and claimed that from its inception to the present moment he had kept the Labour faith. NO ABUSE OF POWER. Mr. Magrath maintained that there was no evidence of abuse of power on the part of the Government or of the Assembly. The motion was designed to get a Nationalist expression of opinion as a counterblast to that given in the Legislative Assembly. It represented nothing but party tactics. Mr. Wise: Why don't you take a referen- dum? Mr. Magrath: II the Nationalist party had secured a majority as great as that as the Labour party It would not have allowed the Upper House to question any of Its legislation. It Is Inherently wrong for any Upper House to stand In the way of the proper expression of the people's will through legislation. Continuing, he said the truth must be known that a Nationalist Government, if in power to-day. would have to join with other Govern- ments which were supporting proposals to re- duce interest. The emergency income tax pro- posals were a necessary and inescapable part of the Government's programme. Mr. P. McGirr said that the present Govern- ment would take a constitutional course In getting rid of the Legislative Council. The Governor had to be relied upon to-day, and, of course, outside Influence had been brought to bear on that honourable gentleman. The President: You are not entitled to dis- cuss matters of this kind. That was most un- fair. You are not entitled to bring his name into the debate. Mr. McGirr: 1 have no Intention of easting any reflection on the Governor. Mr. Culbert said that he opposed the motion If for no other reason than the Indecent haste with which it had been brought before the House. Mr. Farrar: What about the haste of the Assembly? Mr. Culbert added that ""the people who had been defeated at the polls"" had the audacity to want to govern the State still. Sir Henry Braddon said the idea behind the Premiers' Conference decisions was that the prime necessity to-day was that confidence should be restored, and that II the six States worked together with the Commonwealth it would be achieved. The restoration of con Sdence and enterprise was the only cure for unemployment Then came the Premier's proposal for a tax of 5/ in the £. It cut clean athwart the Premiers' Conference plan, and the Legislative Council had rendered a service to Australia by setting aside the tax proposal and giving Australia some chance to save herself. Mr. Lane-Mullins said that Mr. Lang pro- duced an election policy with the word ""re- pudiation"" scored out. The very first measure he introduced was opposed to that policy. Mr. Boyce, replying, denied that a ""class blas"" pervaded the Upper House. Of the 86 members, 41 regularly voted Labour; nine others were appointed by Labour Governments, making a Labour strength of 50 members. The two measures that had been rejected were disastrous, not only to New South Wales, but to Australia generally. He declared that the Emergency Income Tax Bill was only an at- tempt to wreck the Premiers' plan for Aus- tralia's rehabilitation. THE DIVISION. The division resulted: Ayes (33).-Boyce, Braddon.

Messrs. W. and A. Gilbey, of London, con- tribute an interesting letter to tho ""Times"" of October 26 upon tho vintage of 1903, in which rctoronco is mado to the Australian wine In- dustry In the following terms:-The wine production of the British colonies has never had so much interest for British consumers as at tho present time. Although hitherto thcro has been no resumption of shipments to tho United Kingdom of wines from South Africa, which in 1859 amounted to no less than 781,581 gallons, but very shortly afterwards declined to vanishing point, importations from tho Australian colonies have of lato years shown a continually progressive Increase, and ¡ It is confidently anticipated that the con-1 sumption of them in the United Kingdom will this year exceed a million gallons. It must bo borne in mind that in 1859 the wines of our colonies paid only half duly as compared with foreign winos. All duties were, however, greatly reduced, as woll as equalised. In 1SG0. The relativo Importance of our present colo- nial wine trade will he more clearly recog- nised after rofere'qce to tho following table of our homo consumption of all varieties of wine in tho years 1860, 1870, and last year: 1SG0. 1870. 1902. Gallons. Gallons. Gallons. France I. 1,123 «90 .. 1,157,372 .. 5,012,424 Portugal . 1,770,138 .. 2,047,023 .. 3,605,072 Bpatn . 2,975,769.. 0,269,325.. 8,813,717 Australia . »51 .. 3(1,147 .. «00,000 All other countries 1,470,735 .. 1.75S.432 .. 1,800,129 7,353,192 .. 15,168,304 .. 15,348,242 It may almost bo said that, for Greater Britain, the Australian branch is tho only bright spot in connection with the wlno trade. With 10 millions more population, and a larger proportional increase of wealth, it really appears incomprehensible that tho entire consumption of wine at the present time In England should bo only Just over that of 1870, while it Is feared that the current year will show lesa than 15 million gallons, or tbo smallest annual total Vor. tho past S3 years. When it is remembered that this consump- tion is only equal to about two bottles of wine per head per annum of our population, against throo bottles per bead in 1870, and that the French people, who aro only sepa- rated from us by some 20 miles of sea, arc to-day consuming no less than 180 bottles per head per annum, it will bo seen what oppor- tunities exist for a greatly increased con- sumption by tho 42 million pcoplo of our nation, which at least may bo reckoned as among the most opulent in tbo world. When Australian wincB wcro first brought proSilnently before the British public their ready consumption was attributed in a great measure to tho strons sentiment then grow- ing up botwoen tho mother country and her colonies-, but tbe ever-Increasing salo of theso wines clearly indicates that they pos- sess a spoclal merit of their own, which will ensure for them a permanent placo in the wine 'commerce of our Empire. An inquiry into the causes of tho want of elasticity In the consumption of wine in the United Kingdom would, we doubt not, disclose the fact that it Is largely due to our faulty Bystem of levying tho duties. Until somo chango is made in this respect wc cannot hope for any greatly lncreasod consumption of wino, even though we should return to moro indus- trially prosperous times, as tbo two present urbltrory standards of duty-viz.. Is 3d per gallon on wines of all Btrongths under 30 degrees, and 3s per gallon on wines of all strengths between 30 and 42 degrees-consider- ably neutralise tbo Inducement to ship wines of the strengths which would show them In their highest state of perfection. There is no doubt that the natural alcohol in wine, and particularly In moderate-priced wine, ts ono of its most valuable properties. Under our present system a direct incentive exists to ship certain wines as strong as tho limit of the duty will pormlt, apart from con- siderations of quality or suitability, the object being to obtain admittance under the lower or the higher scnlo of wlno duty of as much alcohol as possible. If the question be tho- roughly investigated it will bo found that there is only one truo method of encouraging tho shipment of wines of cvory country and every class at their best, and placing the wino trade upon a sound commercial basis, viz , by taxing wino according to the alcohol It con- tains, as is already tho enso with bplrlts and beor. S«mo 25 years ago an effort wa« mado to concludo a treaty with Prance on the basis, so far.as her wines'wore concerned, of reduc- ing tho duty (of natural wines of low alcoholic strength) from Is to 6d per gallon. Notwith- standing the strong advocacy of Mr. John Bright, the Government, advised by Sir Stnf ford Northcoto (tho then Chancellor of tho Exchequer), did not give the proposal their support, and it was consequently rejected. If tho duty now could bo lowered, so that tho comparatively low-strongthed wines of Aus- tralia, France, and Germany wcro admitted at fid or 9d per gallon, and that above 24 de- grees, wo will tay, all wines paid duty accord- ing to tbe alcohol, a new era might open for tbo wino trade generally, and each country's wine, unfettered by arbitrary imposts and artificial impediments and preferences, would stand far more on its own individual merits. From a Parliamentary paper that has ic ccntly been issued wo leam that, during the year 18ÎI2, 3,535,341 gallons of wine wcro Im- ported from Spain at an avorage strength of over 27 dogrcos proof spirit, whorcas the 987,203 gallons of Australian wlno only aver- aged 22 degrees, or moro than flvo degrees weaker than tho Spanish wine. Both paid the samo rato of duty-viz.. Is 3d per gallon -but In cvory 100 gallons of Spanish wine tbero wcro moro than flvo gallons of proof spirit beyond tho quantity of spirit in 100 gallons of the Australian wine, which, accord- ing to tbe rate of duty on spirits, would have paid an additional duty of £2 15s. To put it in another way, each proof gallon ol spirit contained in the Australian .wino paid 5s Sd per gallon against 4s 7Jd only paid by tho Spanish. It Is not our provinco hero to enter into the question of n preferential tariff for wlno pro- duced in our colonies, but rather to point, out that our present system of levying duties acts most unequally on tho various countries of Europe, and in addition places tho wines of our colonies at a great disadvantage as com- pared with ti ose. for cxamp e, of Spain, Sicily, and Madeira. As this business was originally established in 1857 tor the sale of colonial winos, tho pro- ¡ auction of which was then confined to the1 Cape, we naturally retain a special and ad- ditional interest in the advancement of vluo culturo In tho colonies, for tho development ot which thero appears lo us much scopo in the future. A suggestion was made to us that the time was most opportune to invite some of tbo principal representatives of our colonies to witness In the Mcdoc the gathering and hous- ing ""of this vintage. Amongst others wc had the honour of .ontortalnlng nt Chateau Lou denno the following:-Sir Robert Herbert, Sir Walter Buller, Sir John Cockburn, Sir Charles Howard, the Hnn. H. B. Lefroy (Agent-General for Western Australia), and Mr. Grainger (Agent-General for South Australia). Franco being above all other countries of tho world the best centre of applied viticultural sclonco and practice, these gentlemen had, during their visit to us and at somo of the principal chateaux of tho Gironde, an opportunity of studying on tbo spot tbo methods and practice of the best French wine-growers, which wo trust may not altogether bo without utility to our colonial brethren oversea engaged in the samo industry."

They keep sending the Ques tions to inquiries, hoping that some magic answer that will satisfy all parties will emerge from the ether. Coronation Hill is not an issue in which all panics can be satisfied. There has been enough dithering. The Government should announce that it can be mined, subject to a short-time agreement or arbitration about Aboriginal royalties and com •pe-n-sation, and about minimising the impact of the mining settlement up on their own communities. The question is not, as some would suggest, some test of civilisa tion — whether Mammon should rule over an ancient belief system. By now there is probably more white than black mythology about the sig nificance of the area, not a little of it propagated not by those primarily sensitive to the needs of the relevant community but by those whose antipathy to mining will make them grasp at any straw. As at the Ranger negotiations, Aborigines are again being expected to carry the white man's environmental and demonol ogical burdens. And they are being sadly used — their belief systems being trivialised and translated into apocalyptic visions designed to suit outsiders with their own agendas* their systems of order and communi ty badgered by demands for a demo cratic decision - not any old one, of course, because a ""no"" answer is simply an invitation for the question to be re-opened. The idea that there is a single Ab original view on the mining, or that it is necessarily pro or con it, is quite ludicrous: it depends upon what the question is, of whom it is being asked, and upon what terms and con ditions proposals are being made. These are matters to be resolved in negotiation. The record shows the custodians of their interests to be tough and effective negotiators, well able to represent their points of view. Discussion of the impact of min ing on the local communities and their culture cannot proceed from any assumption that only a decision to mine has a negative impact, or that, if a decision not to mine is made, everything will be wonderful The Jawoyn people and their envi ronment has already been much af fected by white occupation, including mining, of their land: Cor onation Hill is certainly not virgin ground so far as mining is concerned. In the 1950s it was severely mined tor its uranium deposits and-the re maining scar is testimony to the fact that the miners of three decades ago paid little heed to the environmental consequences or the need to rejuve-. nate the land. Even taking only the most recent mining proposals into account, most of the social impact and disruption, both within their own communities and in relation ships with outsiders, which mining has the capacity to create has already occurred. The Resource Assessment Com mission has effectively disposed of the bogey that a properly managed mine poses a threat to the local envi ronment. But it worries about the signal that a decision to proceed would give: ""a further instance of reluctance on the part of Australian governments to take decisions in fa vour of retaining Aboriginal cultural and religious values in the face of potential economic gains from min ing"". But it would also be a signal that a government has again changed the rules, and shifted the scorelines. Whatever the Government decides will affect international perceptions of Australia's economic self-manage ment and its attractiveness as a place in which to invest. Through its own grandstanding on the issue, the Government has al lowed Coronation Hill to become symbolic — it has become the test of rational policy-making, and of the balancing of different rights. As the RAC says, there is a need for a more comprehensive and clear government statement on environ mental, social and Aboriginal objec tives as they affect the mining industry. Those rules can and should be tough, and take account of all sorts of rights and interests. Once made, however, they should not be arbitrarily changed. It is significant that the RAC final report places much more emphasis on the concerns of the Jawoyn people than it does on Coronation Hill's proximity to Kakadu National Park. This suggests that while there are still some reservations about the impact of mining in or near a national park they are reconcilable. THE Federal Government is going to have to make up its own mind about Coronation Hill. The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, told the Australian Mining Industry Council last week that the Government regarded Coronation Hill as a special case. Overseas in vestors are, however, unlikely to dif ferentiate. There should, of course, be absolutely-no question about the Aboriginal inhabitants around Coro nation Hill, the Jawoyn people, de riving some royalty, commission or payment from the development of Coronation Hill. If the mine is on tribal land or if the mining infra structure requires the 'crossing of tribal land the Aboriginal communi ty is clearly entitled to monetary con sideration. They are entitled to set reasonable conditions which serve to minimise the impact of mining and mining communities upon their own communities. It is in many ways fitting that the RAC, although giving a negative re port, has not allowed the Govern ment a particularly easy way out. The Commonwealth has dithered over Coronation Hill for nearly half a decade, it should now make a deci sion and stand by it."

AS YOU drive from Queanbeyan to Bate mans Bay across the vast and elegant land scape of the Federal electorate of Eden-Monaro, there is not one scintilla of public evidence that an election is going on until, some where between Nelligen and the Bay, there is a poster on behalf of Liberal candidate Air Marshal David Evans fixed high on a tree. Strange fruit. David Evans is, in person, a rather dignified man and the dignified expression on' his face in the treetops seems at odds with the indignity of being stuck up a tree. Some days ago, I think near Nimmi tabel, I saw National Party candidate Peter Cochran up a tree and he looked far more at home there, his round, smooth, boulder-shaped head decorated with a disarming grin. Horst Kirchner, the Unite Australia Party candi date for Eden-Monaro, is not up a tree anywhere because he and his tiny party have almost no mon ey for advertising of any kind. I found the flesh and-blood candidate himself on Wednesday in the restaurant of.Batemans Bay's Mariner's Lodge. There was to be an election meeting there at 2pm and Mr Kirchner, who finds public speaking an ordeal, was stiffening his resolve with a few beers. While I ate several dozen oysters I encouraged Mr Kirchner to talk to me about the poor and about Australia's dire straits. Mr Kirchner is a decent and amusing man and a disciple of the imaginative industrial-relations ideas of Senator John Siddons. He was born in Germany in 1946 and likes to laugh at the flaws in his English expression. He was a fitter and turner and worked for the Snowy Mountains Authority for seven years but now is manager of Snowy Welding in Queanbeyan. Snowy Welding is a smallish busi ness, and small business and its tax and industrial relations problems preoccupy him. He believes in unions but wants them to be responsible enough to know when their demands are likely to put an employer out of business. He wants secret ballots for union elections and for votes on strikes, wants unions to have to collect their own union dues and wants industry-based unions. He is for a range of worker-participation incentives and for all sorts of things which will enable small-business people to afford to hire people and to feel that there is some point in being industrious and entrepreneurial. ""We've got lots of policies — don't you worry about that,"" he assured me in a parody of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and reached into his briefcase for the last of the 9000 pamphlets he has distributed, assisted by a son who delivered some by fizzing around Queanbeyan on a skateboard. He recalled, ruefully, handing them out with frozen fingers in Cooma on one recent morning when the tempera ture was minus seven. The air marshal arrived and came to join us. Indicating the sensational view of the bay from our window I told both candidates that I didn't care who was elected since none of them could destroy such a vista whereupon the air marshal, who is a bit of a wit, said he thought he might be able to do something to ruin it. Mr Kirchner and Air Marshal Evans chatted about the awful (and for Mr Kirchner, who was taking a day off work, almost unaffordable) cost of electioneering. Both marvelled at the money spent Horst Kirchner: not enough money to have his picture in a tree. on television advertising for ""Peter"" (Cochran, of the National Party) and Air Marshal Evans told us that all the candidates for Liberal pre-sclection for Eden-Monaro were asked, by the selection commit tee, if they would be able to afford to conduct an election campaign. The fact that Air Marshal Ev ans, just retired trom aeons as a very senior warrior, was able to answer an honest ""Yes"" to that; must have been a ctucial factor in his winning of pre-sc lection against candidate's who had served the Lib erals for yonks and who actually lived in the electorate. Air MarshaL Evans lives, in fact, in (upper) Aranda and bases his tenuous claim to be a son of the Eden-Monaro soil on having a holiday home on the coast. He joined the Liberals only just before his pre-selection but says that he always felt like a Liberal while he was a warrior without feeling that it was quite ethical, then, for him to be one. 1 asked him what things would preoccupy him in the event of his election and he thought that there would be more than enough to keep him busy as a local Member in an electorate with a range of problems and with 23 per cent unemployment along the coast. He thinks the unemployment problem is ""not all that difficult to fix, actually."" He believes that it should be possible to attract lots more tourists to such a paradisiacal place and that a Liberal Govern ment would help employment in the hospitality industry by stopping penalty rates and by paying a ""youth wage"" to youths. At the mention of tourism I mounted my hobby horse and asked him if he didn't think that the contentious native forests of Tantawangalo and Coolangubra (greenies want them to be national parks but Eden's Daishowa woodchip company wants to be able to shave them) should be preserved for ever as tourist attractions rather than be knock ed down to prop up a transitory industry. At this point the air marshal, though plainly a man of great intelligence, bccame a long-playing record of all of the silly and sometimes outrageous arguments prof fered by Daishowa and by the pro-lumberjack ar borophobes of the NSW Forestry Commission. ""Corridors are left for habitat,"" he recited, and ""we'll have better forests in 80, 100 years than we have now"". Wincing, I intervened to say something of my own before the needle could reach the track which says that logging will eventually give us more trees than we have now! ""Our basic policy on the environment is to pre serve it,"" Mr Kirchner volunteered, a note of apolo gy in his voice reflecting'the fact that UAP policies have been cobbled together with some haste and without enough time to go into intricate detail. Word went around that Jim Snow, the sitting Member, would not be coming to the meeting. ""1 don't blame the poor man after what happened to him at Cooma,"" mused Air Marshal Evans's wife, Gail, and Mr Kirchner agreed that, yes, at a similar meeting in Cooma a few nights before, Mr Snow had met with some hostility. And so to the meeting, held in a room reached by crossing a foyer decorated by two framed seascapes of surpassing atrociousness. About 40 souls waited to hear what the candidates who were present (Inde pendent John McGlynn was not there — perhaps his wife had the car again), but first listened to a didactic address from Mr Andrew Robb, the young and ever so dynamic executive director of the Na tional Farmers' Federation, co-organiser of this and other meet-thc-candidates meetings. Mr Robb was scathing about both sides of poli tics and about the way they had run the campaign and had talked ""as though we've turned the corner and as though it's a matter of sharing the spoils"" when in fact Australia was in dire straits and when whoever was elected was going to have to preside over some years in which Australian living stan dards would have to continue to fall. He said, to murmurs of outrage from the good burghers of the Bay, that our sensational overseas debt had been the subject of one sentence in the 52 pages of the Prime Minister's policy speech, and to more mur murs of outrage that the unions were helping to bankrupt us with their laziness and their greed. Small-business people needed some relief from tax es and charges and tariffs so that they could see ""a bit of blue sky"" to encourage them to bother to work hard. Peter Cochran bustled in, a little late, during Mr Robb's passionate and murmur-provoking address. We are so used to seeing Mr Cochran on horseback in his advertisements that it comes as a surprise to see him on foot and to find that he is a small man, albeit a smooth and sturdy and lethal-looking one with the physique and the presence of a small torpedo of slightly bulbous and old-fashioned de sign. Withput Messrs Snow and McGlynn to raise wet, alternative voices, the meeting bccame a little like a revivalist gathering, with the three candidates queu ing to agree with Mr Robb. The air marshal was fluent and artful, Mr Kirchner was halting but sincere and Mr Cochran, who is a bit of a character, was fluent and passionate and funny and scathing about Mr Snow, a tactic which is a little risky since being cruel to the gentle Mr Snow is a little like being cruel to a golden labrador. Mr Cochran said that as he bustled about the electorate he was hearing about business after busi ness which had gone to the wall because of loony taxes like the fnngc-bcnefits tax. Car-sellers and real-estate agents were in particular strife but Jim Snow didn't seem to know or care and was Out of touch with his electorate. To illustrate the anti-incentive failings of our tax system, Mr Cochran, a farmer, offered us the bucol ic parable of a healthy man, a kind of Rambo of the shearing shed, who was perfectly capable of shear ing 200 sheep a day. Rambo could shear up to 100 sheep, Mr Cochran told us, in the knowledge that he was going to pay the minimum tax rate, keeping about 80c out of every $ 1.12 for each sheep denud ed, but after that, as he shore his way towards the 200th, he began to pay more and more tax until, he would be keeping only about 32c by the time he got to the 200th. Why should he bother? Mr Cochran wondered — ""No-one, unless they've got rocks in their head, will bother to shear that 200th sheep!"" Sheep-like, his audience murmured their assent. As for the unions, Mr Cochran continued, and the ability of some of them to spoil our ability to - trade by stopping exports from leaving the county, he would declare the work they did to be essential services and would say to them, ""Withdraw your labour and lose your job. You've got 24 hours to make up your minds. Don't go down the pub, fellas. Stop and have a good think about it, cos when you comc back someone else will be doing your job!"" Mr Cochran, who seems to be a hard man, drooled over this scenario with much the same enthusiasm as 1 had drooled over my oysters with a little earlier. One hobbledhoy, partaking of the fervour, asked any of the candidates present, if they ever did see Mr Snow, to ask him why the Labor Party, ""who wanna wipe out our flag"", had been using the Australian flag so, promiscuously in Mr Hawke's launching and in ALP advertisements. Mr Cochran said that he found it ""absolutely repugnant that they [the ALP] use the Australian flag"", at which point, suddenly finding it absolutely repugnant that I should be indoors and listening to this on such a frabjous day, I went outside into the golden light. On the whan a seagull winked at mc and gave my heart a change of mood. I write about politics but I know, as I do it, that a parliamentary election is a vain and an ephemeral thing and of absolutely no consequencc in the Great Scheme of Things. 1 thought a great deal about the Great Scheme of Things on my long drive home across a landscape which took millions of years of geomorphological sculpting and moulding to assume its present shape and which is not likely to be transformed by three years of parliamentary representation by any of the souls who are chasing that job. The sun will contin ue to rise and to set whoever is in government, though I doubt if it will ever set again in quite the way it did as I drove home on that day with a riot of oranges and vermilions which not even the barba rous palette of Pro Hart could reproduce. God, the Author of all sunsets, paints the occasional shocker and this one was absolutely repugnant."	"prof fered by Daishowa and by the pro-lumberjack ar borophobes of the NSW Forestry Commission .

So those Yvho wore Interested In returned men read In Sydney evening papers ono afternoon In the*third year of the war. Next morning the motor cars Yvcro assem- bled, tho usual crowd gathered, and amidst much cheering the returned men disembarked. Then for the flrst timo wus seen a. tall,'hag- gard Yvoman, who must not long slnco haY-o boen very beautiful, eagerly scanning the fnco of every returned soldier as lia stepped on to the Yvharf. Tho ongerness and lntorost with which she did it woro notlcoablo ovon In that oxcitod, anxious throng, where so many clambered to greet their lovod ones, and Yvh.ro all were aching to know just how they would lind thom.

Amongst those who did como was Captain Shndley, M.C., who together with other In- valided offlcers was driven to tho canteen whoro Joan worked. As soon as ho YY'alkod In he saw her. ""Jean McArthur!""' ho exclaimed. ""You hero!"" ' Jean ' looked «up quickly. 'Sho saw a tall, dark, slim-bulk follow, dark eyed and hand anme In his uniform, ""Jack Shndloy!"" she oxclalroed. Not 'Mr. Shadloy' or 'Captain Shadley' but 'Jack Shadloy.' ""Splendid!"" he said, and went forward with both hands extended; ""I say, this Is ripping, Isn't It, eh? Fancy finding you boro! By Jove, great!"" Joan also thought that it was great. She said so, .though in much moro restrained man- ner than he had used. ""Hore^ Shadley,"" called somcono, ""Come nlong. We'll got Into trouble' if wo don't move off and report."" . Jack turned to Jean. ""Sorry,"" ho sntd. ""Must go. We're on our way to roport. By Gad! what luck we looked In bore on our way.

But would ho ovor como bnck? The thought kept returning to her. George hnd boen'killed; Yvould Ned over re- turn, or Yvould ho, too, ranko 'the gront sacri- fico' as everyone called It, though the great sacrifice was not In dying but In giving up all that some of our men had to glY'o up In colniT « All that day the phrase kept ringing In Jean'B train. ""Will ho over return?"" * It recurred and recurred through a thousand other thoughts, and all her duties of the tiny till beforo to-night Bho had to pull herself up sharply and ask herself what It meant. Will he ovor return? Was she asking It Ned San- derson would oomo back from tho war or would Jack Shadlcy return to tho canteen? Of course, it was Ned of whom sho was thinking she told herself. But before she knew It the rofrnln was at It again, and again sho had to ask horself what It* meant. Finally she decided that It might apply to both. ""If Jack returns to the canteen, Ned will como back from tho war,"" she told herself, and somoho«v found comfort In the fancy, fantastic as it may seem. Jack Shadloy did como back. Next morn- ing, at exactly the same time as ho had ap- peared on. tho picvious day, he carno In. ""Ah!"" he said ""I hoped I would find yon hero at this time"" ""1 almost oxpected you back yesterday, replied Joan. ""Well, you see,"" ho replied, ""wo had to get through nil tho rotton formalities pt our dis- charge. By the time It wns over I thought you'd probably havo gone. I thought I'd make sure, of finding you by coming this morning-Blimo time ns yesterday."" it ivns a ready excuse ""Ohl You're discharged, aro you?"" asked Joan. ""Altogether discharged ?"" ""Vos,"" replied Jack, atmost gleefully. ""Un- fit for furthor service "" "" .""But you'll ho nblo to onllst again If you want to?"" she asked. .""If they'll pass mo,"" roplled Jack, with lesa enthusiasm. Jean noticed the coolness with which .tho suggestion was rocoived, but told horself that this was only temporary. Later on Jack would enlist again as others had done, as al- most nil the other finn chaps had donn. Just now one could not blnmo bim for being a bit sick of It, for wanting to be nt homo for awhile, especially with all tho Interests he had to look aftor. It «vas good of him really, over to have gone., ""."" So Jean persuaded horself that tho best thing sho could do «vas to help rostoro Jack to that normal view of llfo which gonorally appoared to bo wanting In returned men. It would be doing tho right thing and It would be a very pleasant wny of doing the right thing. She had helped more than ono re- turned man to again find his mo'orlngs. Only those who were themsolvos overseas and actu- ally took part In the Great War can over realise how strange overythlng scorned on return. Nono but those who went through tho furnace can understand how characters ««oro run Into such new and strango shapes that on coming back to things thoy had known thoy found the old pointe of contnet had ceased to oxlst, and noiv onos. often quito unoxpoctod ones, lind to bo found.

And tho slinpo of the metnl moro than Ita actual quality Is what meets tho oyes of tho world and very often the eyes oven of those who aro nenr and dear to one. Jack Shadley hn_ rotnlnod nil his old attrac- tiveness. Not only that, but tho experiences through which ho had passod had accentuated tho touch of romnnco that somehow soemod to be part of him. Joan could soo, Bhe could not fail to seo, that other girls envied her the evident friendship with which this hnndsomc officer looked upon hor. And Joan, Uko nil the rest of IIB, male as well na female, «vas subject to delicate flattery of that sort.

HOW WE ever survived the trauma of birth is astound- ing. For nine months we were comfortable in a warm, dark, quiet environment, never knocked around and always fed. Then suddenly our world fell apart and we were cast down a tun- nel, almost too small to get through, into a cold, bright, noisy room and some of us were even held upside down and whacked on the back- side. What an incredible experience and we can't even remember it! How does the fetus emerge into the world at birth and how does nature provide nourishment for the newborn? It all begins after approximately nine months of pregnancy. The mother's cervix begins to dilate. It gets wider so the baby can move farther down into the pelvis, usual- ly head first. The baby is probably apprecia- tive of this because it is awfully cramped inside the uterus by this time. Contractions of the uterus occur periodically, squashing the poor baby and giving the mother a pain, something like a stomach cramp. When the contractions come ev- ery 8-10 minutes, everyone gets very excited and rushes Mum on to hospital, if that is where she has decided to give birth. Labour begins when the cervix has dilated 1-3cm. In the first preg- nancy, it takes approximately 8-10 hours before the cervix dilates 10cm. This is when the baby really feels like it is getting a bit of room and that's the end of the first stage of labour. If the baby knew what was com- ing next, I don't think it would be so pleased at having the extra room. The second stage of labour is get- ting the baby out. The contractions are coming continuously now and the mother has the urge to push down. The baby is presented with a tiny tunnel that may be smaller than its head. Luckily, the baby's skull is flexible and can be squashed a bit to get through the vagina. This almighty squash can take anywhere from one minute to sev- eral hours. The first pregnancy tends to have the longest labour and it shortens with successive pregnancies, maybe as an incentive to have more kids. The head emerges from the vagina and, with a sigh of relief, makes it out. The body follows easi- ly because it's smaller and more flexible. The baby is probably a little dazed after being given such a hard time in the vagina. It's adrenalin has sky-rocketed to a concentration that would kill an adult and now it has to cope with the lights, noise, cold, hunger and possibly being slapped on the be- hind. Life wasn't meant to be easy. Labour hasn't quite finished yet. There is still the third stage to come. This is when the placenta is expelled. It usually comes shortly after the baby, of its own accord and is commonly known as the af- ter-birth. Then, to add insult to injury, the baby, after nine months of hard growing and a most traumatic entry into the world, gets put back to age nought! Pregnancy does not end with the birth We often think of birth as the end of pregnancy, but the mother's body still carries out an important function for the baby. Her breasts have been developing a network of ducts and glands during pregnancy to provide milk to feed the baby after birth. A fetus preparing to enter the ""real"" world. Breast milk provides all the nutri- ents the baby needs for the first 4-6 months of life. Cows need different nutrients from humans and so, unless you hap- pen to be raising a calf, it is probably better not to use cows' milk. Mother's milk also contains anti- bodies that protect the baby from diseases, so a breast-fed baby is often healthier than one fed on substitutes. Lactation, or what is more com- monly called breast-feeding, is also beneficial for the mother. Some au- thorities are convinced that lactation lessens the chance of breast cancer. Regular sucking stops menstrual periods and ovulation so the woman cannot get pregnant again for a while. This results in birth spacing so the mother doesn't end up with four chil- dren, all nine months apart. Breast feeding is very easy. There is nothing to prepare, warm, sterilise or hold — it is just on tap, so to speak. And it is cheaper than milk substitutes. Finally, it helps to get the mother back into shape because a sucking baby causes hormones to be released that contract the uterus and bring it back to its original size. Important for both mother and child is that breast feeding can form a strong emotional bond between them. This provides emotional satisfac- tion for both and gives the baby secu- rity in its new life in the world."	"quiet environment , never knocked around and always fed .

The story of Elmyr . dc Hory, the greatest art . forger of our time. By ? Clifford Irving. Heine matin. 2Mpp. $5-65. THE Mediterranean island of Ibizia seems an in credible and unlikely place for the exposure of a career of art forgery which has hoodwinked the world for over twenty years. The likely places — the gal leries and art museums of Paris, Geneva, London and New York — were subse quently combed for facts to verify the amazing confession of Elmyr dc Hory, alias von Houry, Herzog, Casson, Hoff man and Rayoul Dory-Bouton. It is ironical that the indict ment of homosexuality and consorting with known crim inals which removed Elmyr in 1968 from his white-walled villa in Ibizia (a Hollywood set-designer's dream) was laced with the phrase, ""No visible means of support"". The sophisticated foreign set had enjoyed Elmyr's chicken dinners since 1961. An expatriate Hungarian bachelor, with excellent man ners and cultivated tastes, who spoke five languages fluently was an asset. Gossip had it that he had never done a day's work in his life. Two young art dealers, Fernand Lcgros and Real Lessard, who visited him from time to time were presumed to handle the sales . when necessary of his art col lection of French masters. Oc casionally, if Elmyr was in a good mood, some of his friends would persuade him to sell them privately a small tit . bit — a Dorain, Dufy or Degas, a Vlaminck or a Modi -gliani. The worst that had ever been said of Elmyr was that he was a snob, a parasite and name-dropper, until in 1967, hints of scandal involving Lcgros and Lessard seeped as far as Ibizia. A Texas oil mil lionaire was named as the un fortunate buyer of fake paint ings to the tune of $2 million dollars. Experts had been re peatedly taken in, until the Fogg Art Museum at Har vard doubted the authenticity of a Matisse. Enquiries disclosed that America was riddled with fake Matisse drawings valued at $160,000. Prestige - buying Philistines all over the world looked doubtfully at their Frcnch Impressionist and Post Imprcssionist paintings ac quired during the mid-century boom, and shivered at the name of Fernand Lcgros, now synonymous with the sale of fraudulent art. Success in Los Angeles, ""the easiest place in the world to sell something"", had brought the number of fakes peddled to over a thous and, and although no one as yet had proof of the identity of the hand responsible, sus picion developed into certainty after it was established that Elmyr's villa belonged to Lcgros. The story of Elmyr de Hory, the most prolific and success ful art forger the world has ever known, told in the colour ful words of Clifford Irving, leaves Bonnie and Clyde for dead. Clifford Irving had the story as it were thrust upon him, as a neighbour and close friend of Elmyr, at a period when he seemed no longer able to drown his scruples in Mouton Rothschild 29 or Haut Brion 34. It is a pitiful story of a de prived emigre, whose revenge on society for his rejection would only have been possible this century, when interna tional art dealers ""make a quick buck"" every time a work of art by a big name changes hands. The gullibility and ig norance of today's art patrons creates a very different set-up from the private joke aspect of some past frauds, such as that of Michelangelo passing off his own work as an antique to a small and amused elite. Leger is said to have faked Corots. It was not unknown in Paris in the twenties for a small work by a coming name, to be passed off to tide some nondescript artist over a bad patch. But today's jet-set fraud makes these people look like amateurs. At first the palm-sweating Elmyr sold his own fakes. Later a chain of young con fidence men, with whom he had other associations than employer, handled the sales, giving him time to expand his repertoire. In hotel bedrooms all over the world he forged drawings, gouaches, water-colours and oils purporting to be by Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Derain, Bonnard, Degas, Vlaminck, Laurincin, Modi gliani and Renoir. Then he negotiated with galleries and art museums by mail, until his disastrous three-way associa tion with Legros, twenty-eight year-old con man, ex-cabaret dancer, and Lessard, nineteen year-old beach boy, ended as the story rises to a crescendo of scandal and vulgarity, with himself as victim. First in Budapest, then Munich, Elmyr's carcer as an artist had been a diligent pur suit of technical mastery in the rigidly academic manner. Then, while a pupil of Leger in Paris, he hobnobbed with all those artists whose work he found he could recreate so much more successfully than he could create or sell a first class Elmyr. The story reads like a send up at the point where 26 out of 33 Dufy water-colours and oils at an exhibition called 'Homage to Raoul Dufy', ar ranged by Legros, were by Elmyr. Caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware. A draught of bush medicine By JOHN BRYANT BUSH DOCTOH. By H. IH. Power. Rigby. 165pp. $3-25. READING Dr Power's yarns of his experiences ,as a bush GP in the 1920s and 30s it is easy to see that there is more in a GP's life than appendectomies. There are also indomitable women, bushwhacking ""char acters"", con men, quacks and cranks. Born in Rockhampton, the ninth of ten children of a man who was the first Queenslander appointed a judge to the Supreme Court, the author recalls a boyhood of private schooling, first at Southport, then at Riverview, Sydney. His early home was a huge, rambling mansion at ""Rocky"", complete with carriages, pony carts, servants and the para phernalia of well - to - do people. He was probably fortunate to be able to complete univer sity (Sydney) as his father died while he was still at schooJ. There was also two years' in terruption while the author went overseas as a gunner in World War I. (He served again in World War II in the army medical corps). Cash was short and jobs, even for medical men, were something you queued for in the 20s and 30s. So the young doctor felt glad to be able to get a steady income at a tiny hospital in addition to 'a small private practice in outback Queens land. The years he spent there were obviously far more re warding in a human sense than in a pecuniary way. He spins many a yarn, deftly and wittily, of his en counters with the people of the outback, from the old soli tary man who always carried a hunting knife, could shoot though the eye of a needle and who was reputed to be Steve Hart, of the Kelly gang, to the woman, who, bitten by the deadly adder, promptly chopped off the bitten finger. He allows himself to get up a slight head of steam about an incompetent surgeon who trapped him into assisting as anaesthetist and who ended up half killing his hapless patient. He also shows scant patience with some religious cranks who allowed two of their children to die from diph theria rather than permit their inoculation. He weathered the Depress ion mainly at another country centre in Queensland, Palm woods, a fruitgrowing and milling settlement in the Nam bour district north of Bris bane. As one of the lucky with some sort of income, he and his wife sought every way they could to help the hun dreds of men on the track to earn a few shillings. The pathos of the times dould scarcely be summed up better than in the good doctor giving a skilled tailor his evening jacket to repair the worn silk on the lapels. The tailor sat up on a verandah table, cross-legged, and ap plied himself to the job with the assiduity of one who knew with complete certainty that he did not know where the meal after the next was com ing from. The author has observed well, and relates his stories with simplicity, humour and a good ear for the vernacular. And he does it so pleasantly that one feels sure that he would be a doctor it would be a pleasure to lose one's ap pendix to. _ Figure with Flowers, a Henri Matisse take painted by Elmyr in 1956 and sold in , New.York reputedly ,for $60,000. Modern Australian playwrights By HOPE HEWITT CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIAN PLAYS. Vol 4. Six onc-act plays introduced by Eunice Hanger. University of Queensland Press. 194pp. $2-95. 'JHIS welcome paperback series continues to do for Australia what F a b e r Paperbacks do for .England, that is, bring rapidly and cheaply to the interested reader the script of newly performed plays. This is particularly valuable for a country where every ?sign of interest in the theatre deserves encouragement, and where many promising plays have their first performance in small theatres, often by semi professional or amateur or university drama groups. Indeed this is one common factor about the six short plays collected in this volume: two of them were first presented in the Twelfth Night Theatre, Brisbane, two at the Jane St Theatre, Sydney, under a Gul benkian grant, and one each, at Townsville and at Leeton. Their reception seems to have varied, though Miss Hanger vouches for the success of Ron Hamilton's 'The Spiders' and Barry Oakley's 'Witzenhausen, where are you?', and assures us that Elizabeth Perkins' 'A Squeaking of Rats' gripped its audience. She is less explicit about Irene Summy's 'The Man on the Mountain', but feels with justice that it is dif ferent and well worth inclu sion. The other two plays, Tony Morphett's 'I've come about the assassination' and Michael Thomas' 'The Pier', I saw in first performance at Jane St. Though splendidly produced and acted, they were received there with interest rather than enthusiasm; b'.it they were then stiy at work shop stage — the purpose of the Jane St venture was to give young dramatists the help of discussing their scripts in action, and the version here printed may vary significantly from that originally used. Another common factor in these plays is that all the auth ors who admit their age (five out of six) are under 40. All conform to our expectations in choosing themes dealing with the warped or oppressed psychology of their contempor ary types; all are deeply serious at base, though they are capable of being funny, even wildly funny, in the midst of their seriousness, just as Beck ett and Pinter ari. Indeed these two dramatists come fre quently to mind, but this is almost inevitable in any plays, especially short ones, dealing with non - communication, loneliness, search for identity or any of the contemporary preoccupations. Only occasion ally, in Morphett's play and Thomas', does the influence harden into imitation. For the most part, significant incident as in 'Witzenhauscn', or sym bolism as in 'The Spiders' and 'A Squeaking of Rats' is dis tinctive and effective. The sixth play 'The Man on the Mountain', departs from the tight pattern of a single significant incident, expanding through characteristic dialogue and visual metaphors. It is a dramatic fable about Woman and her attitude to Man, dev eloped in several short scenes and in a strongly non-natural istic mode. Its fantasy belongs to an earlier period than Ion escu or Beckett; it is entirely serious, and its careful thema tic pattern and impersonal typ ing of its characters ('The Man', 'The Woman', 'The Stranger') challenges the pro ducer in a different way from any of the other plays. Miss Hanger's introduction and notes for individual plays are aimed at High School read ers and performances, even at helping amateur or class groups who have had little experience in reading a script. They are relaxed, chatty, tactfully infor mative about absurdity, viol ence, goonery, sick humour and other terms necessary in a discussion of contemporary plays. She has included brief biographical notes about the authors and records of the first performances of the plays. See the world with four books By SUZANNE EDGAR MEMOIRS OF A MEN DICANT PROFESSOR. By D.

J)ENIS Enright is known to many novel readers for his witty and stimulating reviews in 'Encounter', per haps too for his reviews and essays collected and pub lished in 'Conspirators and .Poets' (1966). As a result of all this I expected great things of his latest book. But it is neither about novels nor literature and leaves itself wide open to speculations about the cynical nature of the author's rea sons for writing it. The need to capitalise on a reputation gained in other fields must be a fairly common cause be hind many books of memoirs. Although a teacher of litera ture in Germany, Japan, Thailand, and Singapore during the period covered in the book, Enright spends little time dealing with literary topics and too much on superficial traveller's impres sions in the first half of the book and extensive self justification in the second half. The latter palls quickly, as even the author seems to realise: ""I must seem to have taken far too long over this trivial incident already . . ."" But still he does go on and on over a storm in a teacup, washing out the dregs of in terest in his ""affair"" with Lee Kuan Yew until all the origi nal flavour is lost. The predominant tone of the memoirs is faintly arro gant and defiant. Yet for a respectable academic Enright draws alarmingly wide conclu sions and generalisations about Thai national character from some selected mistakes in stu dents' examination papers in Bangkok. His sly method of implied self-praise by clever denigration of opponent, will not always elicit sympathy for author from bored readers, witness: ""It is impossible not to feel a pang of sympathy- for Mr Lee Kuan Yew, as he strives to make a virile, rugged, fighting little nation out of this collection of ur bane and spiritually affluent individuals. I would myself feel a greater pang if I were not, through a timidity of nature, disinclined to total ad miration of virile, rugged fighting nations"". The Crane' is a tale of white managerial conflict with African industrialisation diffi culties. It is full of stock at mospheric settings: ""Yet this scene could make a colour photograph for people at home to exclaim over: a picture of tropical peace in frail gold light, feathered with casuarina plumes"". Cliches of all sorts abound: cliche attitudes, clichc characters, cliche situations and expressions. The writing proceeds by an odd method of useful initial sentences fol lowed by paragraphs of pad ding. One could read the book by merely tripping from step ping stone to stepping stone as it were, and still suffer little loss of meaning. The story too proceeds in a scries o£ pre dictable jumps through old, old hoops. Adventurer Phillip Connor leaves England, ad justs to African ways, suffers a depression, has a love affair, is involved in problems with native custom, which work themselves out neatly in time for his smooth departure. Surely the market for this sort of saga of white master heroics has practically dwindled right away by now? The Torrent' is Joseph Abruquah's second novel: hav ing read both I have found them not much good as novels but interesting as offering an authentic glimpse of the domestic life of coastal Gha nians. 'The Torrent' is infor mative about changing pat terns in education from generation to generation and is written by a headmaster, so it has plenty of apt sociologi cal observations to offer. At this stage one might ask ""Why not write a social history in stead of a novel?"" 'Tickets To The Devil' re fers to the name the Puritans gave to cards, the novel is about a bridge tournament in Miami. Written by a PR man turned professional novelist it reads like slick advertising copy. Powell has done his homework carefully and soaked up the atmosphere of the thing, become familiar with the bridge idiom and cleverly transformed it all into just another travelogue with a difference."

LYN DRUMMOND recalls the Apollo 11 mission and talks to some of the Canberra men who made it possible. APOLLO a chariot to the stars A DECADE ago next Saturday, mil- lions of people around the world watched with awe as man took his first cautious steps on the moon. They saw Neil Armstrong's boot sink into the powdery topsoil as he took that ""one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind''. The three astronauts who took part in the Apollo 11 mission that put man on the moon will hold a reunion in Washington, DC, on Friday. Reporters, scientists, diplomats and the President, Mr Carter, are to join them to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the epoch- making moment. The three astronauts are now middle-aged. Neil Armstrong, the drug store errand boy from Wapakenocta, is aerospace professor at the University of Cincinnati and farms 50 hectares in his native Ohio. He is non-commit- tal about the way his life has changed in the years since the Eagle, the Apollo 11 landing, module, touched down. Ironically, he is against supersonics like Concorde because they pollute the earth's environment. Mike Collins, who drove the command module Columbia, which orbited the moon while the Eagle was on the surface, is now director of the Air and Space Museum in Washington. Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, who took a chalice and a container of wine to celebrate man's first communion on the moon, later turned to liquor. His 17-year marriage broke up, but after several years of therapy for his emo- tional problems he reckons his traumas are over. The trio were and still are introspective men who cherish their privacy. But they possessed the qualities that the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration wanted: exceptional flying skills, intelligence, strength, the capacity to concentrate and absorb in formation, ice coolness and a natural instinct for challenges. Armstrong, then 38, became the first man to step on the moon. It was 12.56pm Canberra time. Aldrin followed 20 minutes later. To gether they stayed for about two hours. Armstrong said the moon surface reminded him of some American desert country. Aldrin was impressed most of all by the ""variety of shapes, angularities, and other granularities"", of the rocks and soil where Eagle landed. Eagle touched down in the Sea of Tran- quillity at 6.18am Canberra time after Armstrong had manoeuvred the craft man- ually to avoid landing in a ""football field-size"" crater at the target landing site. The world waited as Aldrin counted out the progress of the descent, step by step. Finally Armstrong broke the tension with the words, ""Tranquillity base here. The Eagle has landed"". Both men had little difficulty in moving about in the gravity force of the moon, one sixth of the earth's. They walked warily at first, aware that one false move could mean instant death in the airless, grey lunar desert. Then, as confidence mounted, they jumped, bounded and kangaroo-hopped with glee in front of their landing craft, taking advantage of the reduced gravity. Then routine took over the dream of cen- turies, and Armstrong's boyhood dream. The astronauts, all the while watched by television cameras, dug into the moon's surface, scooped up dust and rock samples and reported their findings back to earth. ABOVE: The new generation of spacecraft: the shuttle Enterprise on its Boeing 747 carrier aircraft. BELOW: Some of the men who helped put Apollo 11 on the moon: from left, Ted Burt, John Saxon, Keith Hiscock, Ian Grant, Bill Shaw, Cyril Fenwick, Paul Mullen, Neville Eyre, Paul Hutchinson, Bernard Smith and Hamish Lindsay in the Control room at Honeysuckle Creek. Then Eagle took off to link up with the command module, and so return to earth. From earth launch to splashdown the flight took 195 hours, 18 minutes and 35 seconds: A little more than eight days. And it is the most trouble-free mission to date. About 600 million people, one-fifth of the world's population, watched on television, beamed to Europe via communication satel- lites over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and ground stations in Japan, Britain and at Honeysuckle Creek and Tidbinbilla, near Canberra. Honeysuckle Creek, about 30 kilometres from the capital, was built primarily to sup- port NASA's Apollo manned lunar landing program. Construction began in February, 1965, and was completed in 1966 at a cost of $2 million. Operating cost is about $ 1,250,000 annually. Australia has the largest number of space tracking and communications stations outside the US. NASA's capital investment in Aus- tralian is about $71 million: $58 million for the equipment and $13 million for buildings, communications and roads. The Honeysuckle Creek site, in the moun- tains 3,667 feet above sea level, was selected because it is shielded from man-made radio wave interference which can jeopardise the reception of signals from spacecraft. The 25.7 metre diameter antenna domi- nates the main control and administration building. Honeysuckle was one of three primary stations erected for Project Apollo. The others were Goldstone (US) and Robledo (Spain). The main control room at Honeysuckle Creek now has a much more quiet air, com- pared with its heyday Apollo period. Fourteen of the men who tracked the Apollo 11 flight are left at the station and seem still to feel the anti-climax that the mission left in its wake. Technician Mr Geoff Ruck said most of the men had had a let-down feeling after the splash-down party at the station. Senior operations supervisor, Mr John Sax- on, who would have changed places with one of the astronauts if he had had the chance, said simulated missions had been far worse than the missions themselves. The others agreed that tension ran higher during the simulated missions. NASA would send a Super Constellation aircraft to the station before every Apollo mission, said technical officer Mr Hamish Lindsay, technical support section supervisor at the time of the first moon landing. The aircraft would fly backwards and forwards across the station, its signals emulating those of a spacecraft. ""NASA ground staff would watch us and give us problems to solve. They would change procedures at every mission and stab them in anywhere. For instance, one of the ground crew had a heart attack and would have to be replaced. If they wanted a small part from the store, they would use to stop watch to time how long it took to get it. The actual mission was much easier than the simulated one, but we were ready for the problems that could have arisen"". The control staff worked 12 1/2 hour shifts and kept humour intact with jokes, graffiti in odd places and a giant cardboard finger, made by one of the men, which pointed upwards for lift-off, horizontally for cruising and down wards for landing. Their biggest thrill was Honeysuckle's transmission of the first step on the moon. John Saxon explained: ""Goldstone was the prime site for the transmission, but just at the time it developed a problem and we trans mitted the world's first glimpse of the moon walk"". Hamish Lindsay: ""The main control at Houston used to wake up the astronauts with march music and songs like Dean Martin's 'Going Back to Houston', and it was trans mitted via Honeysuckle"". Mr Saxon vividly recalls the Apollo 16 mission during which he invited astronauts Charles Duke and John Young to drop in for a beer whenever they were near Honeysuckle. ""They were getting ready to go on to the lunar surface"", he said. ""One of them said he could do with a Swan lager. He had heard the beer was good from other astronauts who had trained in Western Australia. I was able to speak to them after a temporary loss of communications between Houston and the men"". Honeysuckle is now tracking other space craft, including the Pioneer 12 probe of Venus, Helios, the German craft developed for the European Space Agency, which is exploring the sun's environment, and Pioneer 11, which left for Saturn in 1973 and is due to arrive. in September. But despite their significance, these mis- sions do not measure up in excitement terms with the Apollo missions, according to Honey- suckle's moon men. ""We used to have direct visual and voice contact with the astronauts then because it took only a second or so to make communica tion"", Mr Lindsay said. ""Now the information comes back as data"". But station director Mr Ian Grant, who was a deputy director at the time of the first moon landing, is excited at the solar system explora- tion the Apollo missions opened up. ""There is so much we don't yet understand about the climate on earth. Evidence from the solar system could help us find out what upsets the earth's ecological balance"", he said. Pioneer 12 and 13, probing the thick at- mosphere of Venus, could help alleviate further pollution on earth. The clouds of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and drops of sulphuric acid on Venus were 100 times denser than the earth's atmosphere. Mr Grant blames the world's changing weather patterns on the sun's activities. An enthusiastic Scotsman with an infec- tious air of boundless energy, he talks animatedly about NASA's shuttle' service. The shuttle, Enterprise, named after the spaceship in the TV series 'Star Trek', is due to be launched early next year on the first of 500 shuttle flights during the next decade. The shuttles will replace wasteful rockets and act in space as taxis, and eventually as articulated lorries, because they have the same capability as aircraft. The shuttle is designed to carry out mis- sions in earth orbit at a fraction of the cost of present launch vehicles. The use of shuttles and space tugs could help solve earth's most critical energy prob- lem. The US Department of Energy has already pumped $7 million into developing the idea of an enormous solar power-plant satellite, which might be built and served by shuttles, and which would collect solar energy in space and beam it to earth. The NASA communication centre at Dea- kin was the communications link between the tracking stations and the astronauts during the Apollo missions. The centre's director, Mr Kevyn West brook, agrees with Honeysuckle's technicians that, after years of preparation, the moon landing was followed by a curious feeling of deflation. ""It was a case of 'what do we have to look forward to now' "", Mr Westbrook said. ""We were all very tense at the time of the first moon landing and thrilled when the landing was made, but we became almost blase about the later moon missions"". Mr Westbrook was involved with the ori- ginal Mercury moon flights at Muchea and Carnarvon in Western Australia when chim- panzees were the astronauts. He remembers buying bananas for the flight controllers as well as the monkey and misses the individual involvement of those early days. ""Everything now is much more complex and automated, which is as it should be, but personal involvement will become even more remote when the shuttle service is launched"", he said.

He can foresee processing laboratories in space manufacturing pure chemicals which can take on perfect form without the pull of gravity, and colonies on the moon. The $23 billion spent on the Apollo pro- gram, which included five other moon land ings, not only opened up the heavens to man but led to breakthroughs in other areas of research, and to the creation of new products. Among these are a small radio transmitter pill which can monitor deep body temperture, and an aid that can help paralysed people to perform simple tasks. NASA, experts, using a series of devices originally developed for emergency aid to astronauts in space, have discovered that the same electro-mechanical devices can allow bedridden patients to remotely control ap- pliances for their comfort and recreation. Using these aids, a patient can dial and answer telephones, turn the pages of books, open and close curtains and turn television on and off. One system, a ""sight switch"", is actually two switches mounted on a pair of eye-glass frames near the eyes. Each switch has a small - infra-red source and a sensor which detects the difference in relativity between the iris and the white of the eye. To activate the switch, the patient rotates his or her eye upward and outward to look at the sensor near the corner of the eye. Once adjusted, the switches cannot be triggered by blinking or normal eye movements but are operated by a deliberate, oblique motion of the eye. The transmitter pill, designed at Ames Research Centre, California, permits the monitoring of body temperature over a 24 hour period, day by day. A digital computing cardiotachometer, first used by NASA doctors to monitor pulse rates while astronauts were training under water, is now being used in routine physical examinations. NASA and the US Department of Trans- port also studied truck designs that reduced air drag and fuel consumption. In preliminary tests a rectangular test vehicle was reshaped. Rounded vertical cor ners resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in drag at speeds of below 90 and 100 kilometres per hour, and a reduction in fuel consumption of about 15 per cent. Scientists predict the sun will blow up in 5,000 million years. It will take the solar system 200 million years to go around the galaxy, yet man is barely three million years old. ""We don't know where the earth came from or where it is going to"". Ian Grant said. ""Solar space settlements beaming down on the sun for solar energy could be a possible answer to our energy and population problems. The world has the technology for this but not the money"". To most of us such wonders are hard to comprehend; but the millions who watched the moon landing shared with three brave men the thrill of discovery, and witnessed the start of an adventure on which future generations may one day burst from earth and form a new world among the stars."

JAPAN. WILL PKESERVE ' PEACE. FRIENDSHIP FOR BRITAIN. Tho Cónsul-General for Jnpnn, Mr. S. Shl mlzu, In tho cotirso of an Interesting addrosu on ""Japan and tho Poaeo of tho Pacific,"" de- livered under tho auspices of tho Croydon Con- gregational Men's Club nt the local school hall on Monday night, said: Tho Anglo-Japaneso Alllnnco was first signed on January 30, 1902. since when It hns boen revised on two occasions, tho first boing on August 12, 1905, nnd the second on July 13, 1911. Prior to tho establishment of this Al- liance, Russia was regarded (and In some quarters feared) as an ambitious and aggros slvo military Power, In ondenvourlng to ob- tain tho control of Ico-frce ports In tho'Paci- fic, and to threaten tho existing Interests In East India. Gormany was roady and will- ing to assist Russia In theso projects, and to go to greater, lengths in order to obtain poli- tical or commercial advantages for herself. In Great Britain It was the Into lamented King Edwnrd Vii. who fully realised those conditions, and the situations they crontod, and who strongly urged aCsquato measures to be adopted for tho provontlon of posslblo troublo, In spite of the great difficulties willoh then besot any British authorities who would BuggOBt a departure from the time-honoured policy of ""splendid Isolation."" And it was thaso efforts on his then Britannic Majesty's part which secured for him the well-earned tltlo of ""the peacemaker."" Our lato Em- peror, who will bo known to history as MclJI Tonno, was also one of the greatest raonarchs who have occupied a throne, and ho was per- fectly ready to grasp the extended hand of tho fnmous British King. Thus was th« foundation laid of tho guarantee of tho gene- ral poaro of the Far East, a foundation na solid as a rock. It Is interesting to dis- cover, in the speeches of prominent British and other statesmen, the dlfforent opinions held In different quarters upon this tremon dously Important Alliance. On March 17, 1914, Mr. Churchill, First Lord of the Ad- miralty, Bald Inv the British House of Com- mons: ""Our obligations with Japan próvido against (that Is lo say,1 render unnecessary) an increase of ,tho Europenn squadrons.(It In presumed that bo meant British) In the Far East, and there is no reason to suppose that Japan will need Britain's friendship any the leas nftor tho expiry or tho Alliance In 1921."" ' I may ndd here that tho bond between Britain and Japan secured the safoty nnd maintained the repose of Australia. Tli.it «.peech vory quickly evoked In the Common- wealth of Australia nud Ne-w ¡iealnnd i-.\|irc8 slons of dlsBiitlafnctlon nni] nil""glvlns. nnd public statements were made attributing ul- terior motives to Japan. Sumo of those expressions nro Interesting to recall ill tho present moment. In view of tho circumstances which have transpired in tho (Interim. One of those prominent public gentlemen, in alludingt to the matter, expressed . the hope that the'good understanding with Japan might continue Indefinitely, b_t Ho wont on to sny that ""tho pages of hlstorv are strewn v.lth tho wrooknge of fruitless alliance!."" The point of this remark, as ono of Charles Dlekens's characters would say, Iles In Iii application. And what necessity thero was tor this gontlo tnnn to indulgo In mich a reflection on such an occasion ia beyond my comprehension. Another ope Bajd:, ""I am not finding fault with the Imperial authorities, but there Is no reason why the Pacific should bo unpro- tected, no reason why wo should have .10 défonce for our trade routes. ... If war comes it will romo vory suddenly, oven in the Parido, where there aro possible cneinlefl of the Emplro, and wo cannot allow the prcsont position to continue."" The foregoing remarks woro made with re- ference to the neccBBlty'for Australia and New Zealand to defend themselves, and the com- bined foreknowledgo or ability of the promi- nent statesmen of that time to gnugo the futuro was clouded by 'ears of troublo from the north. About that timo, also, one British general was reported to havo made tho following remarkable utterances In Auckland, N.Z.:-""The Pnrlflc, despite Its channing nnrao. Is, if nnythlng, moro stormy than Bome loss distinguished parts of the globe, and while we would all deploro such a contingency, It was concolvnblo that in the future, apart from the storms of Nature, there would be greater and more terrlblo convulsions than In the past. That Is to say, that the rnclflc would bo tho meeting ground not of nations but of continents, nnd here It may be decided whethir Asiatics or Europeans were going to guide the destinies of this planet."" Concerning these utteranrcs, I can only say that they aro evidences' that tho honourable gcntlomon who gave vent to .thorn were Buffer- ing from political nightmare's, caused, as phy- sical nightmares aro, by Indigestion. They had swallowed too greedily tho tales ""which had been told them, most of which wo no» find were manufactured in Germany, and tholr disturbed imaginations and frightful appari- tions wore the result. , ' It is, as I said before, most Interesting1 to recall such expressions at the present timo, for a few months after their, utteraneo tho present war broke out. That was between European nations, but not between continents, and tate must hnvn been In an'ironical mood to cause the Jnpnneso and BritiBh armieB and navies to be fighting sido by side against the German strongholds at Klao-chao, British and Japanese fleets chasing and bombarding Ger- man raiding squadrons in the Pacific Ocean, and Japnneso worships convoying Australian and Now Zealand transports in tho Indian Ocean. Yet I have not ""heard authoritatively that any of these prominent gentlemen have puhlicly oxproBsed regret for their mistaken utterances. The Anglo-Japnnesn Alliance has been bap- tised In blood, British and Jnpancso blood, and blood, we aro told, Is thicker than water. And the British and Japanese nations, to- gether with other brave Allies, aro found to be determined to ftand or fall together In defending ench other against tho common foe. ^ It is surely time that the national alms of Japan, as I have tried to rxplnln them, and her proved fidelity, were clearly understood and acknowledged, even In this quat ter of the globe. You may rest nSBUrod that, como what may during or after the war, Japan will be found protecting the general peace of the Pacifie with all her power, and Indefatlgably and energetically endeavouring to sec that renson and Justice and the common Interests of man- kind shall prevail there, Instead of the brutal forces of militarism, with all their man degrading and soul-destroying consequences. One other point avhich I should like to toueh upon, and which may perhaps be. re Karded with moro interest in Australia than in other parts of the world. In tho final dis- position of the late German colonie« on the littoral of the Pacific Ocean, such ns Klno chno. German New Guinea, the Merslmll and Caroline Iptnnds, and Snmoa. vhlch wero all captured by the combined forres of Jnnnn, Australia, and New Zealand These colonies had hoon acquired bv Germany, ostensibly for purposes of peaceful trade and commerce, hut actually, as has now boon disclosed, for strategic reasons, as naval and military bases According to all appearances it should be centuries before Prussian militarism can be trusted by Australia ' or Japan to occupy any territory so close to our respective shores. It is therefore the strong desire of Japan, as well as of Australia and New Zea- land, that these colonies shall not be handed back to Germany, as, if they were so handed back, the peace of the, Pacific could not be regarded as secure, from the operations pf a threatening and dangerous clement. In conclusion, let mo express my enrnest hope that the terrible struggle now apparently approaching its culmination in Franco may result In MI decisive victory for, tho Allied force3, BO that the peace of the world may be firmly established for all time, and a per- fect understanding fostered and cemented be- tween pooples'on tho littoral of thq Pacifie Ocean, and a free development of peaceful commerce and Intercourse bo assured."

Scene of British Open. HOME OF GREAT GOLFERS. (BY H W S ) Carnoustiel During the past few days, every golfer who has ever flourished a mashle or called for a putter has glibly referred to that famous course I in Scotland, where the world's best players are eagerly striving for the golfing supremacy of the world. This year, the British authorities decided that Carn OILS tie would be the scene of the Open Championship, and at the time of writing the competitors, hailing from all parts of the new and old worlds, are at pre- sent engaged In a battle, with the world's championship title in the offing. Carnoustie. Where is it? The name has a real Scotch flavour, and no wonder. Situated in the County of Angus, It is on the east coast of Scotland, some 20 odd mUes from the tall, smoking chimneys of Dundee. The sur- rounding countryside Is ideal for golf, a fact soon realised by the canny Scots. The course stretches away from a narrow wood of Scots firs to the coast, where the -North Sea hurls Its breakers on to a beautiful stretch of sand. The town of Carnoustie boasts of hotels, boarding-houses, and also a fine sandy beach for bathing. Pierrots use the beach, while chutes and swings make it a glorious place for an outing for children. But the real pride oí Carnoustie are the golf courses. Really, there are two, and It is a Carnoustie boast that the little town has produced more champion golf- ers to the square yard than any other course in the world. But more of this anon. ""COLARIQTJE OP NATURE."" As already mentioned, there are two courses. One is kept for long markers and children; the other is the medal course, the scene of many glorious battles In the past for a ""sax pence"" or a haggis, or whatever those hardy sons of Scotia most desire. The early history of the course is lost in the past. Yet in one publication, Sir Robert Maule (1497-1560) is mentioned as having played on what is likely to be the present Carnoustie course. A de- scription of the golfing knight is well worth perusing. ""He was ane man of comlle behaviour, of hie stature, sanguine in collure both of hyd and hair, colarique of nature and subject to suddane anger. ... He had gryt delyght In hauklne and hountine. . . . Lykewakes he exercislt the gowf, and ofttimes past to Barry Lynks, quhan the wadsie was fir drink. This was the zelr of God 1527 or thereabouts."" ""Colarique of nature and subject to sud- dane anger"" is a delightful touch. Possibly he could have easily brained a caddy if he had duffed an approach. But so could some of his fellow golfers In the year of 1931.' But the present club was really an estab- lished fact in 1842, for then we read of the civic fathers figuring among the medal win- ners. In those days the ground belonged to the Earls of Dalhousie, but golfers were always welcome to use It. Later £1350 was, paid for a large stretch of the ground, on the under- standing that it would always be used for golf. The championship traditions of Prestwick and St. Andrews are not possessed by Car- noustie, nevertheless many of the giants of the past played for huge stakes on the old course, matches for £ 100 a side being not uncommon. And in those days-and unfortunately these £100 Is a lot of money. THE COURSE ITSELF. A rare test of skill! This is the opinion expressed by all after a round at Carnoustie. The fairways and greens cannot be surpassed in the British Isles. The course is on sandy sub-soil, with high sandhills, and a burn turn- ing up In the most unexpected places. In all the burn has to be crossed seven times, and woe betide the topped shot. James Braid had the task of creating the championship course, and so well did he suc- ceed that no two holes are alike. The holes run to all points of the compass, and with the wind coming from various directions every hole has to be played. Braid put in 60 bunkers, tightened up the holes, and thus transformed a fine golfing country Into a test- ing ground for champions. The length is G701 yards, with a par of 72, and a scratch score of 76. ""The long"" hole Is 521 yards (par 5). ""Southward Ho"" is 467 yards (par 4), while ""Home"" is 453 yards long (par 5). But In estimating the pars, one Is inclined to for- get the traps laid down by nature and Braid. That burn is a perfect bugbear, and it sneaks on to you from all angles. Of course when you clear it, ""It's a bonny wee burn,"" but in less successful moments it has been referred to as a ""-sewer."" ""SOUTH AMERICA."" One hole is known as South America. This is the reason. A certain resident, tired of liv- ing In Scotland, decided to leave for South America. To celebrate his departure, his friends gave him a farewell dinner, and then he set out to walk to Dundee. It was ?*. splendid dinner. Next morning when the traveller awoke from a sound slumber, he was near the tenth hole. Hiking the surrounding coun- try, he decided to remain in Scotland, and built a house nearby, which to this day is known as ""South America."" CARNOUSTIE MEN. It's a strange coincidence that, depsltc the excellence of the players from Carnoustie, none has yet won the British open title. But Carnoustie men have travelled and taught the old game in all parti of the world. In this State, such well-known players as the Clarks -Carnegie and Walter-and D. G. Soutar are Carnoustie men. One, Stewart Maiden, went to America, and here the, greatest player of all time, R. T. ""Bobby"" Jones, then a boy In his early teens, 'instinctively followed the methods of the ex-Carnoustie professional. When Jones first played In England, the critics took him for a native of Carnoustie owing to his style. Jones later explained how he came to join the Carnoustie school. This year Carnoustie has Macdonald Smith, now of the United States, to uphold her golf- ing prestige. Whether Mac Smith can win will be known in a few hours time, but he is certain to make a bold bid."

The building's extravagant ex- ternal lighting, reminiscent of the movie palaces of the 1930s, was for many conservationists a sym- bol of the gross waste of energy for which the dam-building authority became notorious in the 1970s and early 1980s. And it was for this reason that the HEC, encouraged by an envi- ronmentally minded state Gov- ernment, flicked the switch on the hundreds of white and yellow flu- orescent bulbs on March 21 and keeps only security lights blazing. ""Our integrity is that we can't Start talking about energy efficien- cy and have our building lit up like a Christmas tree,"" a HEC spokeswoman said last week. But for many Tasmanians, en- vironmentalists included, the five storey National Trust build- ing was a shining and imaginative example of decorative lighting and at night had become part of the character of Hobart's historic Sullivans Cove precinct. The Tasmanian Conservation Trust, which is no friend of the HEC but has long campaigned to protect historic buildings around the state, has accused the HEC of misplaced zeal and Philistinism. ""It [the lighting] is perfectly nice and I like it too,"" trust co-di- rector Sandy Triffin says. ""It's a piddling little effort when they should be looking at the energy efficiency of our major consumers."" University of Tasmania archi- tecture lecturer John Ancher, who made his students regularly study the building at night, says stylised columns of light are part of the original design and as such cannot be considered a flagrant waste of electricity. ""It's a very skilful design,"" Mr Ancher says. ""If you turn them off you lose the significance of that art at its most impressive time."" The HEC is unrepentant, but it admits a fondness for its old head- quarters and almost makes a farce of its own decision by pointing out that the cost of illuminating the facade was only modest. Even green independent MP Bob Brown, who helped break the HEC's firm grip on Tasmania's destiny by leading the No Dams campaign in 1982, says the deco- rative lights are part of the city- scape and should one day be switched on again — but not yet. He says Tasmania is going through a power crisis, with low water storage levels around the state, and the old HEC building and other city buildings should remain in darkness until heavy winter rains arrive. The era when conservationists prostrated themselves in mock reverence before the brightly lit building in the late 1970s has passed into dim memory. — AAP"	"scape and should one day be switched on again - but not yet .

The accesBorles of dress are of the utmost Importance. You cannot look quite correctly turned out unless you are ""en suite,"" as the saying goes-that 1b, you must have nica gloves, Bhoes, hose, and veil. The younger set . does not patronise veils; It can afford to do without them. But those of an older growth usually think the veil gives the final crown to success, and as a rule something not too highly patterned Is pronounced as being ""most becoming."" The finest of net, with rather large hieroglyphics, has been the vogue for Bome little time. An enterprising American dressmaker, who dresses her clients from the very beginning, as it were, introduced a veil for one 3ido only. This meant that one portion only of the face was hidden at the one time. The idea was quite ridiculous, and has not been noticed In Sydney, so far as can bo Boen. Very fow of those outre suggestions ever como to much. Sometimes they may make a fleeting appearance, but later on the material of which thoy aro composed is converted into something moro useful and less remarkable. Some of the more heavily patterned veils give the wearerB a distorted appearance at a little dis tance away. Nothing prettier than the small spots haB ever been Introduced. Spots, how over, are not too good for the eyes, and for that reason posBibly they have been aban- doned in favour of something a little loss try- ing. Then we come to bags. Mounts of all kinds may be had very reasonably these days, and the consequence Is that many women make thom for themselves of matorlal to match the frocks they are to accompany, A pretty idea is to buy some of that ribbon which Is scol- loped at one edge only, and If this be put on In rosette fashion the result is like a big lose. The effect íb very pretty. When making a rosette of this kind with'narrow ribbon, the ribbon must bo left all in ono length. Some folk have an Idea that each row of petals Bhould be cut off an* Joined, but tho proper way to set about tho work Is to got a circle of tailor's canvas or very tbln buckram for a foundation, and then to take the ribbon and gather it along one edge with very strong matching thread, gathering as much at tho one time as it convenient. Then you begin to stitch tho ribbon at the outer edge, fulling It so that it will be slightly puffed. Draw up the thread as you proceed, and when the first row is done stitch down tho second a little further In. Continue thus, drawing up the ribbon and making It a bit fuller towards the centre When your gathering thread has run out thread on another. Go on and on until ""the centre is reached, when turn the cut end of tho ribbon over neatly, and fasten off. Some people like to have a button In the middle, as they think it makes a nicer finish, but the decoration then resolves itself into a rosette, and does not simulate a rose. It you have one of those on either side of your bag you will have something extremely pretty, and something which looks very nice to add to your summer toilette. Other bags which aro popular at the mo- ment are those made of beads. The cheaper ones are fashioned by the machine, but the good ones, which run to as much as £20, are made by hand. There is no reason why work- ers could not carry out the factory Idea if they are not sufficiently pationt to stitch each individual bead down on canvas, the Idea in tho first-mentioned case being to string quan- tities of beads on a thread, and to sew these down, thus threaded, on to a foundation. Dresses may also bo beaded In a like fashion, If the beads are to bo put quite close togother. Thread up to begin with, and then morely stitch down tho cotton on which the thread- ing ig done. White bends alwnys mako a very attractive finish to a dress, but beads are not nearly bo much worn as thoy used to be. In deod, benda and spanglos aro rather' out for the present. Evening bags are of the most lavish description, Some aro fashioned of ostrich foathers, and look delightfully saiart If arranged to exactly tono with the frock. A doll's head and body aro sometimes used for tho top, the skirt portion being disposed ns to form a bag. The lower part of tho skirt is gathered to fit a round mirror. Some are vory elaborato and mnko a dollghtfUl ad- dition to any ball or theatre dress. Paisley ribbon also makos up Into beautiful bags, and anything of tho highly-patterned order Is called Into requisition for a similar purpose. Later on women will be called upon to pat- ronise fur, nnd tho fur bag carried with a boll frock will bo docidodly smart. It miiBt, howover, bo used In conjunction with some- thing in tho way of lace or crepe do Chine. Now that gloves nro bo little worn In the ballroom, there 1» not tho necessity for hav- ing a stock, and this fashion of showing the arma haB naturally boon largely avallod of by dancing folk. For day wear, too, gloves are often discarded, but those people who do wear thom cannot do better than buy the washing suedo which always look well, and aro so easily kept clean.

E. Downes/ dur- ing a talk to members of the Mother'^ craft Society yesterday, stated that lack of such development was the greatest defect found amongst Can- berra children. Strong healthy teeth, he said, de- pended on the presence of Vitamin D. in the diet, and tnls was readily available in fish liver oils, milk, and egg yolk. Dr. Downes dealt with the subject of nutrition, and more especi- ally on the question of foods suitable for expectant mothers and young chil- dren, and the element? necessary for the building up of a strong healthy body. He stressed the va'ue of milk, fruit, nuts, and vegetables for tbe lay- ing of a sound foundation, and de- clared that a well-balanced and vari- ous diet was more satisfactory _ as a means of .supplying the nece's.'.ary vitamins than special medicines, i Mineral elements most necessary in body building included lime, suitable quantities being present in a"" pint per person each day. Lack of phosphorus led to bone deformities, and to safe- guard against this children should be given plenty of milk, fish, eggs, and whole wheat bread. Dr. Downes re- marked that whole wheat contained five times the amount of phosphorus as that found in a given quantity of white flour. Diseases, such as enaemia, were caused by lack of iron in the system. Iron, said Dr. Downes, was present in milk, various types of meats, and vege- tables. The quantity being to some ex- tent governed by the type of soil. The iron content of whole wheat was three times that of a similar quantiy of white flour.

PLANT FEEDING VERSUS SOrL MANURING. Professor Stockbridge, well known as the author of a number of formulas for fertilisers, devoted much study and hard labour to de ¡veloplng the practice of foodlng the plant as against manuring or stimulating the soil. His formulas aro said to bo unique In that they are based not solely on the analysis of tho crop, but on Its power of absorption from all sources of fertility, the air, the soil, and water. His calculations were therefore rested upon tho actual quantity of fertilisers required to produce a given ylold, the na- tural yield of tho soil being taken Into con- sideration. Thus ho launched a proposition that to produce 50 bushels of shelled corn from certain laud, so many pounds each nltrogon, potash, and phosphoric acid would be required, ,or to secure a certain quantity of tobacco loaf of a desired colour and texture, a given amount of plant food olemonts would be neces- sary, preferably in the form of sulphates and nitrates. It was a startling proposition, and | a reviewer In the ""Scientific American"" re- marks that it brought ridicule from many quarters. But Professor Stockbridge did not allow that to disturb him. He knew that the ¡commercial farmer needed a tangible' start- ing point. He know that to consider the needs of a crop, tho living thlug, both as to amount and kind of plant food, rather than the needs of the soil, an unknown and unknowablo quantity, was not only a common-sense way of meet- ing the problem of plant nutrition, but a very direct way of helping the farmer out of tho quagmiro of doubt. The formulas might not be accurate; in some cases they might sup- ply excessive amounts of plant food elements and apparently be very wasteful, yet he bo llieved that in the end it was better economy 'to apply too much, and ensure a crop, than 'use too little and losa a crop. Nevertheless as Professor Stockbridge anticipated would be the case, the fertilisers based on his formu- las were modified from time to time as we gained light, chiefly by the reduction of nl i trogen and tho Increase of phosphoric acid, as it was found that many crops woro able I to gather from natural sources, through bac- terial action or otherwise, some part of the required nitrogen, and that an excess of avail- able phosphoric acid would hasten maturity. ¡It was also found that to supply the full com- plement of nitrogen In addition to what the crop would assimilato for itself tended in .many eases to produce an unbalanced growth, i jet on the other hand it was found that in some eases, especially whero a forced growth or a tender leaf was required, an excess of nitrogen was desirable. Thus It will be seen that the crop was both tho starling and the objective point. Not only Its chemical needs, but its habits and conditions of growth, the object for which It was grown, aud Its market qualities, wero all factors which Influenced the composition or modification of the fertilisers; and the same factors are as potent to-day. Since then it was the crop that chiefly concerned Professor Stockbridge, how natural and sensible was his question: ""What shall I supply you to make you a perfect and profitable crop?"" Lot us now consiuer tor a moment anoiuei phase of the subjeet, namely, tho potential fertility of the soil, or the natural yield ' to which Professor Stockbridge fiequently le ferred It lins boen known for a long time that piaetically all tillable soils aro rich In plant food elements, and yet many of them aro barren, and most of them will not pro- duce profitable crops without the aid of ma- nure or fertiliser Piofessor Frederick D Chestei, of Delaware, states in an able bulle- tin, recently published, that an average of the results of 4J analit.es of the typical soils of the United States showed per acre for the first eight Inches of surface 21001b nitrogen, 4S001b of phosphoric acid and 13,4001b of pot- ash The average yield of wheat In the United States Is 14 bushels per acre Such a crop will remove 29 71b of nitrogen, 9 51b of phosphoric acid, and 13 71b of potash Now, it all the potential nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash could bo rendered available, there is present in such an avetago soil, in the first eight inches», enough niuogen to last 90 years enough phosphoric acid for E00 years, and enough potash for 1C00 years This is what Is meant by potential soil fertllltj and yet such a soil possessing this same high po- tential fortuity nm>, under certain conditions, be so actually barron of result to the farmer as to lead him to believe It absolutely devoid ° In a"" word potential fertllily represents plant food which is so tlfchtlj locked up that It ih not available for present needs and lecomes available only through tho procos of decnv and disintegration which is too 'slow to meet the requirements o' the cora modal larmer Professoi Stockbridge liealised the situation, but instead of ask ing the soil how much of the potential for tmty could bo depended upon for each crop (question which will never bo satisfactorily aiiswciod), ho went to the crop and asked it Sow much it was necessary to supply foi an avèrasë yield in a normal nason cyr and abovo tho natural yield 'of the land. In all casos ho found It to bo a very Bmall quantity. For the corn crop not over 2001b of nitrogen, potash, and phosphoric acid was necessary, which tho crop would return flftyfold (at least Ilvo tons In stalk and grain)-so little to produce so much-and yet if this little quantity of 2001b was not supplied tho crop ¡would bo a failure. Ii. was this little essential balance of avail- able plant food which stood between success and failure that concerned Professor Stock- bridge, as it concerns overy fanner to-day. Although It was small, he did not deem it wiso to depend upon tho potential fertility of tho soil to supply it, or even any consider- able part of It. For tho commercial farmer I it was too risky and uncertain. To ensure a crop, as far as one was able, was a cardinal |principle with him; not to do it was in his eyes almost a crime. But he felt that all these things would right themselves as we came to know more about farm crops and their environment. Simply put, tho later practico amounts to applying fertilisers in such a form as to cu ablo the crop to mako immediato uso of all the plant food. The best illustration of the principio on a broad scalo In Australia is the application of soluble manures to tho wheat crop. The plant Is supposed to ab- sorb the quantity of fertiliser applied each year, nnd this really accounts for the fact that a moderate quantity produces as good and sometimes a botter yield than a heavy application. As a rule, moro than 501b. of superphosphates is moro than the crop re- quires on tho average wheat land. If the manure were not immediately available, the groaler part would go to manure tho soil instead of to feed that particular crop. A principal objection to (his practice is that a lot of tho fertilising elements are eventually washed away, evaporated, and so lost to both soil and plant. The main principio of the now science of fertilising is to take out in the season tho money that is put into the land, nnd thin san only bo dono with profit by feeding the plant with somothlng which it can absorb as it grows."

There is the ANU's Research School of Biological Sciences and the Centre for Re source and Environmental Studies, and sci entists in other departments working on environment-related topics. There are the CSIRO Divisions of Soils, Entomology, Plant Industry, Water Resources, Forestry and Forest Products and Environmental Mechanics. There are geologists at the Bu reau of Mineral Resources and trained sci entists in various Government departments and the CCAE. And Senator Richardson can always phone up the Chief Scientist, Profes sor Ralph Slatyer. The consensus so far is that the new envi ronment statement is welcome as a broad brush program for action. But there is a strong element of disappointment, if not distrust among the ranks of scientists. What were their immediate impressions? The Director of the Canberra-based CSIRO Institute of Natural Resources and the Environment, Dr Roy Green, said that he felt it was ""not a bad"" first step to moving down the track towards a comprehensive environment policy. But he was disappoint ed that the CSIRO had had so little input to the document. He looked forward to the Australian Sci ence and Technology Council's review of environmental research and welcomed the emphasis on land care and reforestation. The Chief of the Division of Soils, Dr David Smiles, said he welcomed and sup ported the statement. The recognition of Senator Graham Richardson: Can get plenty of advice in Canberra. land degradation as the major environmen tal problem in Australia was welcome. But, he said, there were large gaps. ""We lack information necessary to achieve land-care objectives. For example, to achieve sustainable and profitable grazing and farming systems, greater knowledge of soil processes is needed."" And, he said, there was a serious shortage of trained personnel. The head of the Australian National Uni versity's Centre for Resource and Environ mental Studies, Professor Henry Nix, said ""My initial reactions were ones of disap pointment, and a feeling that it was a 'pump priming'exercise. ""I can't say anything positive, about the money. For example, $320 million over a decade for land use won't go very far. The money for the National Soil Conservation Program will be useful, but a lot the sums are, in themselves, just a token of interest."" ""But on my second reading some import ant policy decisions emerged which do re flect major changes... The key decision is making the Minister for the Environment a member of the Structural Adjustments Committee. This represents a very import ant change in the Government's way of op erating because it means that it is putting the environment right in there where they make the economic decisions. ""The expressed intention to be a good global citizen is also a good move, and it is actually committing Australia to do far more in the way of finance than appears in the document."" Other things, he said, were disturbing and reflected departmental aggression and a lack of cooperation. There were also, he said, a lot of words of intent: ""will foster"", ""will play a part"" for example, but with no money attached. As for the $1 million to establish and maintain the Institute of Tropical Rainfo rest Studies in Cairns, Professor Nix said that $ 1 million might purchase two pieces of Professor Henry Nix: Remarkable document but 'pump-priming'. prime real estate in Cairns, while the CSIRO already had the Tropical Rainforest Centre at Atherton. The ""Save the Bush"" effort was very im portant but he would have given it a higher priority than the billion trees. It was most important to find answers to the questions, ""Which trees, where and why?"" Not enough information was given. ""But it is a remarkable document. I'm not aware of any other government producing such a document on their environmental actions and intentions."" a Deputy Chief of the CSIRO Division of: Plant Industry, Dr Brian Barlow said, ""My"" first impression is that it is a band-aid apf; proach which doesn't provide much in the' way of resources to address some of the really fundamental questions — like what options wc have for managing land systems. ~ ""It is understandably a reaction to public^ anxiety and media attention on environ!-, mental issues but it... looks as if the right sort of consultation has not taken place. For"" instance, if you do set up inquiries to in vesti-* gate the problems you will still need money to address them."" The Deputy Chief of the Division of For estry and Forest Products, Dr Sadanandar Nambiar, said he applauded the statement as a Government pledge to carc for the environment. ""However, behind several of the propos als, for instance for soils and trees, there lies an assumption that wc have the knowledge base to effect and properly implement the program. This is not the case."" In most cases, he said, more should be known about trees and the environment be fore a billion trees could be planted, cared for and retained successfully. ""If this marvellous initiative isn't backed up by appropriate research and use of the results, we may plant a billion trees but only one million may survive and grow."" Nothing funny about sexual harassment By VERONA BURGESS IN THESE days of so-called equal opportunity, the image of the drooling lecturer, smelling faint ly of alcohol and chasing a desperate fresher round the tutorial room seems out of date. But is it? A phone-in by the National Union of Students in 1988 showed a disturbingly high level of sexual ha rassment on tertiary campuses throughout Australia. And accord ing to the Students' Associations of both the CCAE and the ANU, it thrives on both campuses. Now, the CCAE has marked a week in August as sexual harassment awareness week as part of its efforts to promote equal opportunity. Sexual harassment can be fright ening, humiliating and thoroughly unpleasant. The President of the ANU Stu dents' Association, Mary Todd, says that it does occur at the university between staff and students. But per haps the most well-known type is between students. ' ""There is a particularly serious problem in the halls and colleges,"" she says. ""One example is the unhi larious . and often out-of-control 'practical jokes' which place women in compromising physical or psy chological positions, such as a wom an being thrown around by men in a violent 'game', or her college room or living space being invaded or up ended. Then there are the ignomini ous competitions where men try to sleep with as many first year women as possible in a set time to outdo their peers in proving their 'man hood'."" The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 requires that all forms of sexual harassment in the workplace or the classroom be eliminated. The ANU's position is that sexual harassment is unacceptable and some help is available. There is a special telephone line and students can go to the counselling centre or the students'association. But Ms Todd says the university P lacks a serious commitment to ad hering to its stated policy and that it should be doing more. ""It needs to recognise the fact that the student population changes on a yearly basis and distribute informa tive and supportive material to new students every year. ""The current sexual harassment grievance procedure, while it may be helpful at intervening in and resolv ing a problem, does not enable any formal or punitive sanctions to be applied to the offenders in cases of student-student harassment, and does not provide the victim with the option of remaining anonymous. ""It needs to define and recognise student-student sexual harassment as a breach of conduct and to require halls and colleges to do the same."" At the last council meeting, in re sponse to a question from Ms Todd, 'Not welcome, solicited or reciprocated' the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lau rie Nichol, undertook to set up an inquiry into the matter. The CCAE Students' Association sees it as a real problem on campus. Research officer Ian McShane says it should not be seen as a problem of individual misconduct. ""Sexual ha rassment is probably the most sensi tive and difficult form of discrimination to deal with and the most difficult to detect. Many vic tims do not lodge complaints."" College procedures, he says, do preserve anonymity and do not con duct hearings in adversarial settings. They do seek to modify behaviour rather than punish offenders. ""However,"" he says, ""too often it is the victim whose behaviour is modified, by, for example, transfer ring from a tutorial or changing a study program."" -.1 . = He points out that sometimes the procedures protect those who are do ing the harassing by diffusing com plaints. ""For example, the CCAE' has a procedure for appealing against a wrongly-awarded fail result. Howev er, it can only be considered if the published assessment or review pro cedures have not been followed. Subjective issues, such as the per formance or behaviour of the teach er, will not be considered. A failure because of the sexual harassment of a student by his or her teacher, then, cannot be appealed against. A sepa rate complaint must be made to the Sexual Harassment Committee. Clearly this is unsatisfactory."" The college procedures do ac knowledge that it is not simply a staff-student issue but can be stu dent-staff and also student-student. They acknowledge the problem of harassment of young female stu dents by male peers, especially in the residences. Mr McShane says sexual harass ment can appear in a number of guises. ""It may take the form of per sonal comments or physical ges tures. It may not be fully conscious or purposeful behaviour. Unaccept able behaviour on the part of teach ers may be passed off as attempts to make students aware of a rough-and-tumble industry environ ment. Is it like this in the real world, or docs this emphasis build into the curriculum attitudes and practices which are not accepted anywhere?"" Ms Todd puts it more graphically. ""Sexual harassment includes a range of behaviours, nearly always perpe trated by men, which are unwel come, unsolicited and unreciprocated by women. They range from unwelcome sexual re marks, to staring, to actual touching — pinching, slapping, hugging, kiss ing, sleazing, massaging, groping — and of course to rape itself."""	"taken place .

Only someone who had believed the public opinion polls could have hoped to predict the result. Last week there was not a single MP or Senator, Liberal or Labor, who would predict a substantial Labor victory. The Liberals were predicting a narrow Liberal win, by one scat in the 35 member House of Assembly, with the possib ility that the parties could be split 17-17 with the remaining seat going to an independent. The Labor men were equally convinced the poll result would be borderline. They were sug gesting an 18-17 victory for Labor, but conceded there was a very good chance of a 17-17 1 result. The final figures will not be available for more than a week, but Labor's victory was the greatest it has achieved in Tasmania since 1941. It has won 20 seats, has a reasonable chance of getting another one, and an outside chance of yet another. In terms of total votes, the Labor Party had won 55 per cent of the total formal vote, and the Liberal Party 39 per cent. This was an improve ment of more than 6 per cent for Labor of the formal votes cast and counted to Sunday night. For Labor the most satisfy ing result was that it will win a majority of places in each of the five electorates. It has been unable to get a majority in the Hobart seat of Denison, the one Liberal stronghold in the island, in the past 31 years. Given the size of the swing, why was no one aware of it in advance? The main reason seems to be that the Liberals had a tremendous public re lations and advertising cam paign, and were supported to the hilt by all the Tasmanian newspapers. Labor men simply did not believe that the voters would react against all this pressure. T ABOR lost the last State election in Tasmania three years ago because of dissatis faction in the seats based around Launceston with the amount of development in the north. When the Liberals came into power they spent a con siderable amount of effort on northern development. They were fortunate that the Labor Government had drawn up many plans for the area, but had not put them into opera tion. But the figures suggest that the people of the north were not very impressed by the Lib erals' efforts. They swung back to Labor very strongly. The Labor Government which had faced the polls in 1969 was a fairly tired and old government, which had been in power for '35 years. Labor took the opportunity of its breather in the wilderness to bring forward many young candidates. Six of the Labor winners last Saturday are under 30. It is dangerous lo try to generalise from a State poll to Federal election prospects, but there are undoubtedly many pointers from Tasmania which will be carefully studied by both Liberal and Labor strate gists in Canberra. The most probable cause of the Liberal defeat in Tasmania was the fact that the Govern ment was demonstrably torn apart by internal divisions. The elections were forced by the defection of the Centre Party from the Government, in the form of Mr Kevin Lyons, its only representative. On top of that the Minister for Health and Road Safety, Dr Abbott, resigned just as the campaign was beginning. Dr Abbott was rejected by the voters on Saturday; Mr Lyons did not even bother to contest the elections. But it was not just the individuals who suf fered. The whole Liberal Party lost support because it had de monstrated its lack of unity. The federal parallels are obvious. Mr Gorton's presence on the backbench is a contin uing reminder of the divisions within the Liberal Party. Whenever Mr Gorton makes a public appearance, sugges ting ways of improving the economy, or fighting inflation, he deepens Ihe wound. He docs not need to talk about dis unity for it to be evident. The Liberal Premier. Mr Bethunc. also attributed his de feat partly to the state of the economy. Tasmanian unem ployment has been higher than the national average, so the cffccts elsewhere may not be as great. Besides, the Com monwealth has a few more months to get the economy into higher gear before people take a definite decision about the way they will vote in the next election. One interesting result of the election was the comparative failure of the conservationist ""United Tasmania Group"". It only gained about 4 per cent of the State-wide vote, and its best performances of 7 per cent and 8 per cent were in areas where it had well-known candidates who were heavily supported by university and other groups. rJpHE conservationists were in an ideal position to max imise their vote. Their stand to save Lake Pedder had been rejected by both the Liberals and Labor, so there was no one else angling for the conservat ionist vote. The figures sug gest that the UTG won most of its support from the Lib erals, but this will not be known finally until preferences have been distributed. In a federal campaign neither of the major parties will be ""against"" conservation. The Liberals are certain to come up with some policies from Mr Howson's Depart ment of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, while Labor's Mr Uren is already pushing the environment issue very hard. There is no real room left, for a separate con servation party to move into in the federal sphere, at least, not with any prospect of electoral success. When all the experts and politicians were making their predictions about what would happen in Tasmania, one fac tor they disregarded was the fact that public opinion polls have shown a national trend towards Labor. The Gallup Poll has also shown, in a State by-State analysis, a huge Labor vote in Tasmania, in excess of 60 per cent. This was disregarded partly because the sample of Tasman ian voters is so small that the reliability of the vote attribu ted to Tasmania is far lower than the national vote. It was also accepted that there would be different issues in the State poll from the federal poll. The last point is probably correct, but it certainly appears that there was a flow-on of a nat ional issue, the economy, which did tell against the Gov ernment. The Tasmanian result sug gests that more attention ought to be paid to the Gallup Poll as an indicator of what will happen in the Queensland elec tions late next month. The last Gallup Poll suggested that Labor's vote in Queensland was less than 45 per cent, which would give it no chance whatever of victory. Local factors like the popularity of the Brisbane Lord Mayor, Clem Jones, who is leading Labor's campaign in Brisbane, might improve Labor's vote, but the ALP really seems to have only a very dim chance of victory. One other consequence of the Tasmanian election will he that Labor will redouble its ef forts to capture the one {out of five) Tasmanian House of Representatives seat that it does not now hold, Denison. The Liberal's Dr R. J. Solo mon won the seat narrowly in 1969, and a 2.6 per cent swing would remove him. He was helped in 1969 by the presence of an independent Liberal, Mr Townley, now an independent Senator, who won many Labor votes. In a more direct battle Dr Solomon may be in some difficulty, particularly in view of Labor's achievement of winning Denison in the State field. Labor now has control' of three State governments, ad mittedly in the three smallest States. It has moved a long way from the days of 1969 when for the only time in 40 years it had no representation in government in the Com monwealth and the six States. The one consolation for the Commonwealth Government at this stage is that the Country Party-Liberal coalition in Queensland should have a good victory next month, which will restore sonic morale in time for the elections in November December."

COLOMBO. I t . -« ' '. ' (UV K.J.'«-.) ""Thc'Claphsm'Junction of the East"" is the' not altogether inappropriate designation fre- quently given-to Colombo. -Paterson, nn ob- servant"" writer,'described the capital of Ceylon as^'the junction at which West and East meet."" This phrase appeals with greater torco andconveys an Infinitely more, accurate Idea of actual conditions than the ftrst-montloncd comparative expression. Less than a' decade ago Port Said was, in popular estimation, the contact point of East and West. But the East of Port Said, and Egypt for that matter, is a frowsy' Orient compared with that East the Indian Ocean divides from the Straits of Bab el-Mandeb. The tourist who Imagines that he secures an acquaintance with the East by a visit to Port Said, or a season spent In Cairo, hugs a delusion. The East there found, from a strictly Oriental point of view, Is neither fish, fowl, nor good red herring. Hence tho real 'meeting of Occident and Orient cannot be said to be actually effected at the Mediter- ranean -entrance to the Suez Canal, or the littoral thereof. At Colombo, however, not only does West meet East, but it may, with almost equal truth, be said that North meets South. There Is no port In the world, espe- cially during the months known as ""the home- ward season""-March, April, May, Juno, and the early part of July-at which so many peo- ple belonging to so many divergent nationali- ties can bo met wltb in so short a space of time. Every, civilised country in Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America, and tho Isles of the Pacific will be found repre- sented. This representation frequently par- takes of a dual character, those in transit and thoBe w_oso business compels a residence in the island bo rich in fable, history, nnd na- tural beauty. During the tourist season that part of tho year between the homeward and outward seasons, the months of October, No- vember, December, and January, holiday seekors from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, South Africa, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, and Russia aro to be encountered In yearly In- creasing numbers. Colombo is the central calling place on many ofthe great trade and passenger routes of the world. Passenger steamers bound to and from Australia, Burmah, Calcutta, Java; China, Japan, the Philippines, South Africa, Europe, and Bombay aro regular visitants; and it is no uncommon sight to soo live or six grent liners, each with a full complement of passengers in tho harbour at one and the samo time. It would bo difficult to find a more in teresting'Btudy than theso passengers present, whether tho place of contemplation bo the streets, the jewellers' emporta, or the spacious lounges of tho Galle Faoe, Grand Oriental, or Bristol hotels. The observant resident be- comes an adept at localising, in a national sense, a passenger. Dress, drinks, and de meanour compose his deductive machinery, the working of which, in Its results, but seldom orrs. Take the Frenchman, homeward bound from Saigon, further East, or Noumea. His helmet, narrow and deep, as plainly denotes his na- tionality as though capped by a miniature tri- colour. His enormously baggy white drill trousers, tightened round the shoes-""to keep the mosquitoes out""-as the innocent, inquir- ing one Is frequently tola-are as distinctive In their way as the helmet. If; these outward and visible signs should fail, there is the walk- ing stick, most frequently of ponderous pro- portions, which Is a part and parcel of 09 out of every 100 Frenchmen when on shore at Colombo. In the category of ""drinks,"" the Frenchman's nationality is writ large. En- tering one of the hotel verandahs he sits at a table. The ""boy"" ut once asks, ""Absiuth^, m'sleur,"" and it is rai ely he mistakes lila quarry. It it Is not absinthe, It Is claiot or burgundy, occasionally beer tlager or Bass), and at times whisky and soija, for the French- man in the Far East Ima of late years takeu Bomewhat kindly «to the wine of Scotia. Sup- posing these tests of dress and ""drinks"" fail, there still remains that of demeanour. If the Britisher procluims himself by his demean- our lu a positivo degree, the Frenchman does in a superlative one. Gesticulation, inflection of voice,'the huudrcd little mannerisms, as pronounced In the' most fashionable boulo vardler or officer us in the most ordinary bour- geois, render doubt out of the queBtlou. At Colombo the French passenger ^excels himself, and his deportment, no less than his hubll uients, proclaim uloud, ""Liberte, Egulito, Fra- ternité."" But your Frenchman drives a harj bargain. The native Jewellers w,ho speak ii smattering'of French, as do the Bombay mer &lt;hunts who deal in Indian wares. lind itwts difficult to squeeze money out of him as blood from the proverbial stone. ""Frenchman,"" they say,'""oo good muster;-no spend money. Eng- lish, American, Australian masters very good; spend plenty money""-which, being Intel - preted, is that' the aforesaid ""English, Ameri- can, Australian masters"" have"" not learned the art of successfully resisting the .blandishments of those who would load them with ""the won- ders of the Orient,""'as Indeed they acton prove to be when examined from the hurd, commer- cial basis of actual value and prices paid. Tho commercial expansion, and consequent- ly increasing wealth, of Germany Is forcibly impressed on the observer upon passenger days In Colombo. Generally speaking, the Teuton in. its euslly distinguishable as the son of France. Physically, he usually an- nounces his nationality. ' Of generous girth, extraordinary capacity for drinking beor, and doing remarkable justlco .to the really ex- cellent meals the great hôtels provide, of stentorian voice and definite assertlveness, he is characteristically German. The ex. ception Is, perhaps, provided by the German baron or count who comes out to ""shoot big gjirae."" He, most frequently, is sartorially a' fearful and wonderful product of the Ber- lin colonial outfitter. Leather gaiters, trou- sers of a strange texture add stranger cut, coat ditto, and head adorned by a soml sombrcro, from which depend the ends of an enormous muslin puggaree; he furnishes an object of considerable Interest. He is, tis it were, the apple of the jeweller's eye. Usually he Is prodigal of his money, and on departing It is that the dealer In gems of infinite variety and value thanks Allah for having given to 'German infidels bo much money in order that the sons of the Prophet might be so well rewarded for their faith- fulness. But the uverago German on shoro at Colombo is prodigal In nothing save eat- ing and lager beer drinking. It Is few marks the traders get out of him; hence he is placed in the -""no good master"" column by those wonderfully clever gentlemen. Rickshaw und Sharrl wallahs, pedlars, beggars, and fortune- tellers know the German as soon sb he lands. He is practical, sentiment makes no appeal to him. save the sentiment most often allied with the school of LucuIIub. From the strict- ly personal point of view, he makes the bi-at of his time on shore, and does it st a figure which makes clear that he understands the fine are of minimisai. For several years, prior to 1904, Russians were as f..mlllar .sights in Colombo streets as rickshaws. They were mostly Immigrants and soldiers, and presented the lowest form of Eu ropean humanity the natives had ever soen Ignorance, dirt, and drunkenness distin- guished them. They furnished a striking ob- ject-lesson of the effect of Rijsslan methods or government; a lesson the natives enjoying British rule may have taken to heart. Rus- sian officers and merchants.' however, are distinguishable by dress and manners. * Thev mn«? n? tt°r?u.at Colomb°.

The few wealthy Italians who visit Ceylon for rest and recreation are, like most of their fellow countrymen of education and position, charm- ing people. The Japanese arc rarely absent from tho throng on tho passenger days. .To visitors and rcsidonts alike they arc of Interest. In- variably well but quietly dressed, they go about their sight-seeing, purchasing and hotd ing with that serious thoroughness so typical of ovcrything the Japanese undertake. If Englishmen uro supposed to take their plea- sures sadly, then surely they must1 be tho gayest of peoples if comparison with the Jap- anese passengers encountered at Colombo -s - instituted. However, with all their methodical stoicism, they are respected, and treated with the utmost regard by European und native alike, for it Is recognised they represent a people who have not said their last word, or made their last move, in the unsolving of that mighty problem summed up in the single word ""Asia."" , The Chinese passengers encountered at Co- lombo aro either noblemen of the land ot Cathay, or servants. The former always con- stitute the centro of attraction, with their gor^ geous silk apparel, wondrous footgear, anu black silk tassolled skull caps. What effect the revolution will have on tho picturesque garb remains to be seen, but opinion would point to its disappearance in favour of the drab uninteresting habiliments of European conventionality. Servants aro common enough whenever *-a Far Eastern passenger steamer happons to bo in harbour, and they have hitherto lent a pleasing variety to the already variegated scenes in streets and hotels. Generally women, ""armahs"" or nurses, with white cotton trousers and black dilk buttoned up coat extending down to the knees, they aro not infrequently taken for ""boys"" by various . natives engaged in one or the other numerous forms of extracting money from those who are birds of passage. The Chinese, like the Japa- nese, spend little on shore, consequently oro not viewed by all classes of residents with too friendly an eye. Indian .potentates,- Mohammedan, Buddhist, and Hindu divines and ""holy"" men, from other Eastern lands, may frequently bo seen landing at or leaving the passenger jetty, and tho spectacle uhually supplies to the westerner a picture puroly Oriental in every detail, from the bewildering mass of coloured apparel worn by the crowds, tho weird monótono melody of the chants and musical instruments used, to ceremonials consisting of garlanding with flowers or sprinkling with rosewater tho in- dividual it is desired to honour. It is the ex- ception, and not the rule, that an Indian prince, or r- 1er, Is met with at the leading hotels, though potentates, such as H.H. tho Agah Khan, chief of the Mohammedan mil- lions of India, who are indistinguishable from Europeans In manner and dress, aro occasion- ally pointed out to passengers at the Gallo Face or Grand Oriental Hotel. Indian rulers who do not adopt European garments whoa travelling aro at once recognised. As In ancient days was cried, ""Great is Diana of the Ephcsians,"" so those who live, move, and have their being in Colombo cry, when surveying the local passenger world, ""Grout Is the race of the Anglo-Saxon."" To European and native, the Anglo-Saxon, if not always a thing of beauty, Is certainly a joy, and a most profitable joy too, tor ever. Bri- tish, American, Australian, and Canadian comprise the Anglo-Saxon battalions Colombo so gladly opens its arms to receive They come in a mighty and annually-growing host, and Colombo erics out, on regarding tbo influx, ""the more the merrier."" There is no possibility of mistaking the Anglo-Saxon. His expatriated brother, long resident in Tapro bane, comes to regard him with tho intorost displayed by those racy of the soil, but for different reasons. Tho Anglo-Saxon visitor marches up from the jetty, swarms ovor the hotels, fills the shops, commandeers ghalris and rickshaws, and stamps his prcsenco on most roads within a seven-mile radius of his landing-place. A Panama hat (real or Imita- tion is Immaterial), with brim usually turned In a style less artistic than is possible, an umbrella, and n camora form a no inconsider- able portion of his impedimenta. After whirl winding through the Fort hotels and retail establishments, he drives round town, ""does"" the Museum, In the Cinnamon Gardens, rushes out to Mount Laiiuia, lilfs himself tp roplc tion with one of the far-famed prawn cur- ries, and arrives back at the Gallo Face.

R. Smithson, of Cambridge Regional College, reported the finding of a fossil reptile in Scotland, which seems to be the oldest reptile yet found. It dates back about 338 million years. This may not seem very import ant since most of us don't think much of reptiles, snakes, lizards, turtles, or alligators. But if we dis miss them we are wrong, for they are extremely important creatures. To see why, we must go back in time. Some 450 million years ago, the earth was about 4000 million years old, and life had existed on il for about 3000 million years at least. In all that time, however, life had ex isted exclusively in water. The dry land was sterile. About 450 million years ago, how ever, the first plants began to appear on shore and the tidal area began to turn green. The earliest land plants had no roots or leaves, but the pres sure of evolution produced these, as well as stems, and by 400 million years ago, the first forests covered the land. Why did it take so long for life to emerge on land? Well, land is a hos tile environment, with a strong grav ity pull, with extremes of temperatures, with the possibility of drying out. It took thousands of millions of years for life to develop the devices that could counter these difficulties. For 50 million years, plant life lived in isolation on the land. Then animals began to follow. The plants provided a plentiful food supply and any animal that could develop ways of enduring land life could multiply freely. The first animals that emerged on land were primitive spiders, scorpi ons, snails, worms, and, eventually, insects. They were all small crca tures. They had to be small so that the pull of gravity would not be strong enough to immobilise them. For large land creatures to devel op, they would need to have limbs and bodies stiffened by bones. In short, we would need vertebrates. Four hundred million years ago, there were swarms of vertebrates, but they all lived in the water. They were the fish and, to this day, they dominate the oceans of the earth. Some fish had delicate fins that were fitted chiefly for steering and propul sion, but some had sturdy, fleshy fins that were almost like small legs. These fleshy-fin fish were, by and large, not as successful as ordinary fish, but they had one advantage. If they lived in a pond, which grew brackish or threatened to dry out, they could stump across land into another and larger pond. Such fish developed the ability to stay out on land for longer and lon ger periods. They developed primi tive lungs that allowed them to breathe out of water. THESE were the ""amphibians,"" who seem to have made their first appearance about 370 million years ago. They were the first large land creatures. Some had the size and appearance of modern croco diles and were formidable creatures. They had one important flaw, however. Their eggs had to be laid in water, and while they were develop ing to adulthood they remained fish like. The most familiar amphibians today are frogs. Their eggs develop into tadpoles, which only gradually become frogs. On the whole, then, amphibians were tied to the water and were not truly land creatures. Then came the reptiles who , evolved a new kind of egg, one that | contained complex embryonic membranes called an amnion. The elT had a shell that allowed air to enter and leave but not water. It came with a water supply sufficient for the developing embryo, and the wastes were deposited within the amnion. This ""amniote egg"" could be laid and hatched on land, making the reptiles the first true land verte brates. For more than 250 million years they dominated the land, pro ducing the magnificent dinosaurs. IT IS important to remember that birds are simply modified rep tiles. They are warm-blooded and have feathers, but they lay reptilian eggs with an amnion. Mammals are also modified reptiles. They arc warm-blooded and have hair, but when they first appeared, some 200 million years ago, they laid reptilian eggs with an amnion. The birds and mammals were not successful while the reptiles domi nated the Earth. They were small creatures who survived only because they were largely unnoticeable. They were the equivalent of sparrows and mice, peeping about in the shadows of the great reptiles. If the dinosaurs had not been wiped out by an asteroidal collision 65 million years ago, birds and mammals might still be nothing creatures today. It was the development of the am niote egg that made everything else possible. So when we find fossils of the oldest reptile, we may have in hand remnants of the creature who invented the crr on land. . Los Angeles Times"	"turn green .

'?Actually, it's rather annoying."" Mark's audition this particular after noon for the Canberra Boys Choir was Kathy's attempt to give some structure to her son's hobby. Instead of having to listen to whatev er Mark had just heard on the TV or radio, over and over, Kathy figured she could extend his repertoire through weekly choir practices. The audition went okay. Mark was clearly a little nervous. And suddenly changing hats from the Top 40 to scaled ""la, la, la's"" is no mean feat before afternoon tea on a Monday. He can clearly hold a tune but he lacks the confidence to punch it out. The choir's musical director, Maijor ie Lindenmayer, was impressed with Mark's persistent interest in music and some prior learning. The choir is rather short of members at the moment and she's not about to keep places open for allusive little Pa varottis. Mark's in, but he does have to brush up His skills in the preparatory choir of boys before joining the more earnest Wednesday afternoon group, the Cho rale. The juniors are invited to join at the age of six and must move on before their yokes break. The older group includes boys up to 14. Six-year-old Jonathon Sykes is your archetypal choirboy - wavy haired and angelic, with skinny legs swinging tinder his seat. Jonathon's the youngest member of the Canberra Boys' Choir but his mum, Melissa, says that his looks are about the only thing angelic about him. ""It's not as if he fits some kind of mould of a choirboy,"" she laughed. ""There is no particular type of boy who likes singing. If you listen to them talking in the break, you'll hear that they're typical boys. It's just that they all love to sing."" Jonathon was singing before he was talking. And it wasn't that he came from a musical background - Melissa can't even remember singing to him as a baby. Natural ability But because he has such an obvious natural interest and ability, Jonathon's parents decided to offer him some for mal training young.

""I think singing is one of the very few areas where boys are at a disadvantage in mixed groups. ""They will just about always be out numbered and they're more likely to feel stigmatised.'' !t wasn't compassion that prompted Gail Ford to form the Canberra Boys Choir in 1981. it was the fact that boys' treble voices are thought to deliver the purest of tones, free of the vibrato that girls sometimes carry. The preparatory choir meets once a week for one hour and provides a gen eral introduction to musical training, including a basic understanding of written music.

The more advanced Chorale prac tises for two hours a week and sings a wide range of secular and sacred music. The group appears regularly in local opera productions, weddings and other musical events. Simon Praut is head chorister of the Canberra Boys' Choir. At 13, Simon says that although singing in a choir is ""swell"", especially when they perform for money, soccer is still his favourite pastime. ""I've always enjoyed singing,"" said Simon, ""ever since I was about four years old. Being in the choir has just taken my interest one step further. ""There's nothing sissy about the choir. We all get on really well and have breaks during practice. We bring balls and stuff, and it's a really good way to make new friends. ""When I was in primary school some of the boys thought it was weird that I sang in a choir. But high-school kids are more mature and they just accept it. ""The only reason I like soccer a bit better is that it's something you can talk about more easily at school. ""I still don't find that many of my other friends are interested in talking about the choir."" Kathy Vicol isn't sure yet how Mark is taking to his first afternoon. He, too, was a little concerned about the image of being a chorister and pre ferred the idea of joining an all boys choir. ""I guess it was my idea that he should come,"" Kathy admitted. ""He enjoys his singing so much, I thought it would be great if he could share that with other people. ""And I know that if you can develop an interest and understanding of music and singing when you're young, it can become a lifetime love."" Kathy, Mark's little sister and I have been watching him this first afternoon. He's singing with other boys, but rather quietly. The body language is difficult to read. ""He doesn't like it, I can tell,"" Mark's sister whispers loudly. ""So now he won't get the new basket ball shoes, will he?"" ""I only said he had to give it a go,"" Kathy whispers back.

Value of Improved Pasture. TESTS AT TEMORA FARM. In order to obtain information regarding the I comparative values of grazing lucerne, top dressed natural pastures and untreated natural pastures for fattening lambs, an experiment was commenced during 1930 at Temora Ex- periment Farm. Thirty comeback ewes were mated to Dorset Horns, and at the conclusion of the lamb- ing the lambs were divided as evenly as pos- sible by weight into three groups, there being 10 lambs in two of the groups and nine in the third, one of the ewes having failed. This took place on August 21, when the three groups of lambs with their mothers were placed on their respective pastures as follows:-(a) Lucerne, (b) natural pasture topdressed with lcwt of superphosphate to the acre; and (c) natural pasture unmanured. The lucerne pasture contained a small per- centage of barley grass, wallaby grass, and trefoils, while the natural pastures consisted mainly of barley grass and trefoils, with a small percentage of wallaby grass. The quantity and development of trefoil was greater hi the topdressed pasture than in the area unmanured. Seasonal conditions being for the most part favourable there was at all times ample suc- culent feed for each group. Periodical in- spections of the lambs were made, and it was seen that the lambs on untreated natural pas- tures did not make the same rapid progress as the other two groups. On October 21, two months after the lambs were placed in the various pastures, and when approximately three months' old the groups on lucerne and top-dressed pastures had reached suitable export weight, and arrange- ments were made for marketing. The lambs were despatched from Temora on November 4, and slaughtered on arrival at Homebush Abattoirs. Mr. J. B. Cramsie, chairman of the Metropolitan Meat Industry Board, made arrangements for the killing of the lambs, and furnished a report showing the frozen weights of each group as follows: (a) Lucerne pasture, 10 carcases. Average weight 37ilb. (b) Topdressed natural pasture, 10 carcases, average weight 38.41b. (c) Untreated natural pasture eight car- cases. Average weight 28.621b. (One lamb in this group died on September 23). Reporting on the trial, Mr. E. A. Elliott, sheep and wool expert, and Mr. A. W. S. Moodie, assistant agrostologist, state that the results clearly indicate that even under seasonal conditions favourable to natural pastures, im- proved areas such as lucerne or topdressed natural pasture are greatly superior to un- treated natural pasture for fattening lambs quickly. They point out that no attempt was made to record the carrying capacity of the various pastures in this trial, as it was desired to allow each group ample feed in order to test the quality rather than the quantity of the feed. In average years or dry seasons lucerne should carry more stock per acre than either topdressed or untreated natural pasture. The Department of Agriculture has con- sistently advised the necessity for improved I pastures or supplementary feeding with fodder crops in the production of early lambs, and the results of the trial support this view."

Part III The role of the policeman The ascendancy of the Pacific Islands Regiment is undermining the morale and efficiency of the Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary, ALAN D. GILBERT writes from Port Moresby in this concluding article of his series. Part I, published on this page on Wednesday, asserted that Australian policy -was selling the stage for militarism in an independent Papua-New Guinea. Part II yesterday explained the danger of military civic actioji projects subverting the civil Administration. Here Gilbert suggests changes that should be made if the Territory is to avoid the trail from colonisation to military rule. WITH the Port Moresby South Pacific Games less than three months away, sporting officials and coaches in Papua and New Guinea are ex periencing all the diffi culties associated with poor facilities, lack of finance and the inacces sibility of potential champions. The sportsmen of the Pacific Islands Regiment, however, are untroubled by these limi tations normally inherent in the Territory situation. With more than a hint ot jealousy, a leading athletics coach recently admitted that ""the Army's programme . . . of bringing its own top athletes from all over the Ter ritory to Port Moresby,'put ting them in a special group under Captain Claud Smeal, providing them with excellent facilities and training pro grammes three times a day, plus other motivating bonuses is ideal"". But it is an ideal which no other organisation in the Ter ritory can approach. In a somewhat amusing contrast, for example, readers of 'Kumul', the official organ of the Papua and New Guinea Police Association, have been reminded that, although the Vanimo Constabulary has Responsibility for any tltclinn com ment In thlj tone U taken br John Ulan. been provided with ""a javelin, discus and shot"", in general the time and money involved in police sport must be that of the individuals concerned. Highlighting a more serious aspect of the contrast, another 'Kumul' correspondent added that police sportsmen are limited also by the paucity of their diet. ""This is particularly difficult in the Constabulary"", he explained, ""where many centres do not have regular supplies of meat available and there is insufficient storage space; and salaries make the purchase thereof difficult any way"". In contrast with the in capacity of the Police Force adequately to provide for the recreation of its members, the indulgent attitude of the Army, with its unmistakable overtones of prestige-seeking, is but one index of the serious imbalance which has devel oped between these two guardians of law and order. gECAUSE the PIR is the natural reference group against which members of the Constabulary measure their own conditions and social standing, the ascendancy of the Army is undermining police efficiency and morale. Before the enormous mili tary development began in 1963, there was unrest among indigenous soldiers who felt that their conditions compared badly with those of the police. In January, 1961, the Police Riot Squad arrested 74 mutinous soldiers as they marched into Port Moresby from nearby Taurama Bar racks. Now the two groups exem plify Reference Group theory in an cxactly reverse way. They are roughly equal in numerical strength — each having something over 3,000 men — but on all other criteria the Army has enor mous advantages. Since 1964 the Department of Defence has spent twice as much in Papua and New Guinea on its building pro grammes alone as the Con stabulary has received in total financial allocations. Although PIR salaries have been made subject to the Pub lic Service Salaries Ordinance, apparently bringing them into line with police salaries, in fact immense fringe benefits leave the soldier far better off than his counterpart in the Con stabulary. At the time of the - 1961 PIR riot an investigation re vealed that, although in digenous soldiers were poorly paid, their fringe benefits — free food, clothing, accommo dation, and medical and dental services — were the equivalent of 60 per cent of what was then the urban cash wage. The Army has a. high standard catering service, and indigenous, soldiers eat the same, food as their European officers. On the other hand, even police officers' messes are not supplied with either cook or food. The Police Department's housing programme is years behind the rate of recruitment, and the morale of the force in evitably suffers as a result of the prolonged separation of members from their wives and families. But the P1R is able to provide its married recruits with separate and, on Terri tory standards, completely satisfactory family quarters. Soldiers have access to free military medical, hospital, and dental services; policemen wait their turn at public hospitals and dental clinics. AT the Police Training Col lege at Bomana, outside Port Moresby, there are no properly qualified teachers. European officers arc called ""off the beat"" to instruct re cruits. And for the vital . psychological screening of 1 potential policemen, the Police Department has to wait until officers in other government departments have spare time. In contrast, the PIR has.ex cellent educational facilities staffed by almost 70 trained teachers, many of them univer sity graduates, and a well qualified psychological unit. A posting to Papua and New Guinea is an attractive prospect for an Australian .Army officer because,, classi fied as ""overseas service"", it is valuable for promotion pur poses. The Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary, on the ' other hand, has little chance of competing with southern forces in the. recruitment of top-quality police officers. Certainly. some very able men have been recruited, but the dearth of such ap plicants is reflected not only in low general standards but in the recruitment of a num ber of ex-colonial policemen from Africa whose presence in the force has not improved its standing with educated New Guineans. These disadvantages of the Constabulary relative to the Army are accentuated by its comparatively invidious his torical role. While in British societies the role of the policeman has been to uphold a traditional system of law and order, to protect long-established pat terns of public behaviour, in New Guinea the Constabulary, has been the main instrument in the enforcement of an alien legal code. Historically, the police have been collaborators, acting with the European against an in digenous majority, and if police action becomes neces sary in the present Bougain ville land dispute, policemen will be called upon to uphold European property law against the claims pf traditional legal ownership. The Army, on the other hand, historically the defender of the Territory against Japanese invaders, is currently judged on the basis of its well publicised civic-action pro grammes. 'JPHIS situation is dangerous, If the independent New Guinea of the future is to re main a constitutional demo cracy, it will require a police force capable of guaranteeing interna] order and security. But while the Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabu lary remains, in the opinion of the public and in fact, a second-rate force relative to the PIR, its chances; of sue. ccss seem slim. ? ? ' Changes are necessary. The PIR, if it really is being developed as a ""people's army"" for Papua and New Guinea, should immediately be placed under the surveil lance of the House of As sembly, like other Aus tralian agencies of Territory development. The development of the PIR should be slowed down, per haps in favour of a greater emphasis on the Territory's citizen military organisation, the Papua and New Guinea Volunteer Rifles. The present meagre allocation for the Constabulary should be increased significantly, and special emphasis should be placed on upgrading the conditions of service, the efficiency and the morale ;of the force. Otherwise, Pajjua and. New Guinea might be destined to follow the well-worn trail from colonisation to military rule."	"way "" .

Those most subject t'p'fdetection, apprehension, conviction and nega tive sanction tend to be ""small fry"" who represent only the tip of the iceberg. ""H6w big the ""iceberg"" is in medical fraud and abuse, is a matter of opinion. Government esti rriates, initially based on computer profiles of phys icians' billing practices and official figures in 1982, gave conservative figures of fraud and abuse total .Jingbetween $100 million and $130 million a year. This estimate was confirmed and accepted by the Australian Medical Association. These estimates later rose to $200 million a year in 1984, although SdHib'physicians and statisticians strenuously de nounced the large government-based figures. ' ^'Dr Denis Mackay, past president of the General . Practitioners Society of Australia, believes that fed eral authorities are wrong in their estimates, and ;that;they ""collate data, arrange the so-called facts and ""then make estimates to fit into their precon tfeitfed fraud pattern"". 'TT Inadequate resources /""^While it is conceivable that the official figures Overestimate the amount of physician fraud and atiuse,' it is also possible that the figures are underes timates. As we will see, only a small amount of fraud' is actually detected, and an even smaller ""^portion prosecuted. In addition, inadequate staff resources in the Fraud and Overservicing De tection Scheme and bureaucratic difficulties in co ordinating inquiries into fraud and abuse produced figifds which, in David Gordon's phrase, represent the ""tip of the iceberg"". ' """"""Financial damage aside, medifraud and overscr vjcing have devastating effects on the health system 'generally and on patients specifically. Unnecessary surgery,- for example, performed only because a government or private insurance program will pay tHe^cbst, can result in maiming or death. It is apparent that those doctors defrauding the system 'irf'leSs dramatic ways - for example, by giving quicker non-existent consultations - arc also pro viding sub-standard medical services to their pa tients: It is also clear that superfluous laboratory test^ and unnecessary office visits and minor sur gery are not in the patient's interests. Already escalating health costs are further in creased by medical fraud. In a submission to the Public Accounts Committee, the Hospital Contri bution Fund medical insurance body claimed that overservicing has become so widespread that doc tor's accept it as ""a style of practice management in Australia rather than as a dimension of anti-social behaviour"". It can reach the level which the manag er bf Medibank Private described as ""fraud and overservicing like mad ... any way you can make a quid"". It is relevant to note that medical tribunals dealt with 3774 cases of doctors who were ""coun selled"" with respect to possible overservicing be tween April 1,1977 and September 30,1983. ?' Just how big the ""quid"" is, depends on the esti mate of medical fraud and overservicing accepted. Th6 federal Department of Health suggests that somewhere between 900 and 2500 doctors are de frauding Medibank. Depending on which of these extremes is accepted, and whether the total cost of medifraud is $100 or $200 million, each doctor would be reaping at worst $40,000 and at best $222,222 from fraudulent practice. This income is an annual amount, in addition to the large sums that doctors earn in their medical practice. Clearly, it is most unlikely that the average defrauding doctor is obtaining the upper limit of these figures, but the sums are nevertheless significant. What follows here is a brief description of some illegal practices most clearly the result of ""corpo rate"" or organised activities among two or more medical or paramedical practitioners. Patients' health and the system can be devastated Losses in fraud and overservicing are possibly highest in the pathology area. Interviews I have conducted with Federal Police investigators suggest that cases in this specialty are almost impossible to prove. Initial tests are generated by the referring doctor, but the pathologist has the power to gener ate further tests if so desired. No tests, other than the initial collection of specimens, are conducted in the presence of patients, so there is no opportunity for even rudimentary patient monitoring. Ineligible health screening and orthomolecular pathology are also often claimed for, by using allowable item numbers for claiming reimbursement. In 1984, it was revealed by Mrs Helen Mayer, a member of the Public Accounts Committee, that the.top 25 private pathologists collected $36 million .. in,m,edical benefits in three months. At least one specialist lent his name and qualifications to obtain a higher fee, and was not physically able to perform the services. The top provider in Australia received $4.6 million in benefits during the three-month period. While these figures are, in themselves, no . indication of massive fraud and overservicing, it is : clear that pathology is increasingly a highly concen trated industry that is basically unregulated by the Cqmrnonwealth. That large amounts of money are illegally ob tained for pathology tests is admitted by the Royal College of Pathologists itself. The vice-president of the college, Dr Llew Davis, in giving evidence to a parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, esti . mated that at least $20 million a year in overservic itig-arose from ""fast-photo"" style laboratories. Dr ' Davis pointed out that, under current legislation, doctors and laboratories could easily split fees for such, work so there was a motive for both parties to overservice. jNursing homes are another source of corporate ;,ny$ical crime. Not uncommonly, groups of pa tients are signed up in a health fund, then placed in a Htirsing home in which the referring doctor has a financial interest. The same doctor then visits them d&ily or even several times a day, often over a period of years. These visits are often as perfunctory as saying ""hello"" in the hallway, but are still claim able as a brief visit. -One Federal Police investigator recounts the case of a Brisbane physician who, in partnership with other practitioners, owned a private hospital and hired a bus to collect patients and bring them to the hospital. They then would be seen for a short period of time and taken back home again by bus. ~ Psycho-fraud, or the exploitation of the schedule ' of medical benefits by psychiatrists, in a common fdrin of medical crime. Gadiel and Opit examined the 'payouts by the HCF in NSW for the years 1977-79. They found that the top 10 earners among psychiatrists in NSW constituted only 2.5 per cent of the psychiatrists in private practice, but account ed for 10 per cent of the dollar value of psychiatric services. Of particular relevance in the context of corpo rate medical crime was Gadiel and Opit's finding that a significant portion of the excess was finding its way to a relatively small number of psychiatrists who taught psychotherapy and psycho-analysis. The costs were generated when these practitio ners psycho-analysed psychiatrists and other health professionals who were studying under them, as part of a training program. The fees for this inten sive therapy excced $1000 a month for each stu dent. With, for example, six students training four days a week, a psychoanalyst could obtain an in come of more than $70,000 a year, in addition to any other salary or income. While both government regulation and the Col lege of Psychiatry disallow psychiatrists claiming benefits for training sessions, no action has been taken against the offending doctors. Expensive equipment A third example of ""organised"" medical fraud involves the purchase of expensive medical'equip ment by group practices. Spirometers, electro cardiographs and X-ray machines are common items. The Public Accounts Committee reports that installation of expensive X-ray equipment in a gen eral or group practice, at a cost of $20,000, is almost invariably followed by prolific use of the machine with the attendant dangers inherent in its use by inexpert hands. These examples of corporate medical fraud are clearly only some of the possible forms of abuse. Most fraud and overservicing is undoubtedly con ducted by individual practitioners working in isola tion from other physicians and engaging in one or more of the following: . Time-shuffling (where the patients are deliberate ly treated after-hours); . Upgrading (billing for services more extensive than those actually provided); . Injury enlargement (overstating the nature of an injury treated); . Ping-ponging (referring the patient to another physician where there is no need for additional care); . Phantom treatment (claiming for operations or procedures never performed); . Assembly-line production (having patients pass through surgeries at a rate that makes adequate medical treatment impossible); . Other variations of these practices. Whether fraud and abuse is ""organised"" or con ducted individually, certain structural features of fee-for-service medicine, enshrined in government and private health-insurance schemes, provide what has been called a ""crime-facilitative environ ment"" for medical crime and deviance. The fee-for-service nature of medicine in Austra lia and the oversupply of doctors are two factors which contribute substantially towards medifraud, although the incentives for illegality built into fee for-service do not, in themselves, explain fraud. Undoubtedly, the over-production of medical graduates and the competitive nature of medical practice does contribute. In 1972, 878 graduates were produced from Australian medical schools. For 1982 the figure had risen to 1305. Between that year and the year 2001, the supply of doctors in Australia will have doubled and the doctor population ratio will decrease from 1:521 to 1:405. Opit has printed out that one result in this growth of medical manpower is increased competi tion for patients, reflecting, in surgery at least, a massive increase in acute episodic care especially associated with operative and investigative proce dures requiring hospital admission. When it is real ised that the rate of tonsillectomy, for example, had declined markedly in England and Sweden, but is still at a high level in Australia, especially for pri vately insured contributors or their dependants, then quite critical questions are raised on the moti vation for these operations. Workload the same In terms of general practice, Najman and West ern report that, during the 1970s, there was a steady increase in private medical services given per head of population. This increase began well before the introduction of Medibank and nas continued ever since though, as Najman and Western note, ""It is curious that the average doctor's workload has not increased during this time"". It is not only the competitive marketplace, but also the training and aspirations of doctors which contribute to those forces propelling some doctors towards fraud and abuse. Anderson, Western and Williams, in an extensive longitudinal study of medical students, note that student doctors become much more conservative and professionally orient ed during their training, a socialisation process which increasingly makes realists out of idealists. Trainee doctors overwhelmingly come from high-status homes and develop narrower pragmatic and self-interested concerns as well as expectations of affluent lifestyles. These expectations are fuelled by commercial enterprises which bombard doctors with brochures and by salesmen touting the wares of the consumer society - expensive foreign cars, real-estate and investment opportunities. Profes sional organisations also contribute to the view that medicine is as much a business as a caring or ""helping"" profession. A number of writers have documented the oppo sition that both the Australian Medical Association and the General Pracitioners Society have shown towards Medibank and Medicare, and their pro mulgation of the view that the doctor is a small businessman with the inalienable right to preserve unfettered fee-for-service practice and autonomy from government review. The emergence of such medical pressure groups as the NSW procedural specialists, determined to ensure that members' incomes are maintained, suggests that financial re muneration will continue to dominate the politics of medical organisations. As a public or government issue, medifraud held a low priority until December ! 977. In that month, an investigating officer of Medibank Private exam ined a US report of medical fraud and prepared an estimate of medical fraud in Australia on the basis of the US figures and his own investigations. His superior rejected the report, so the officer left Medi bank Private and subsequently talked to the media. However, despite sporadic media attention to the event, politicians ignored the issue until in 1982, a federal Department of Health officer, overcome by his frustration at inaction against defrauding doc tors, listed 41 files on doctors where his investiga tions showed presumptive evidence of fraud or overservicing ignored by his superior. In defiance of the Public Service tradition and the Common wealth Crimes Act, he sent that list to the Public Accounts Committee. A formal Public Accounts Committee inquiry was begun on May 25, 1982, leading to a series of reports. At this time the federal Department of Health had 200 doctors on its active file and 210 more files were in the hands of the Australian Federal Police. Gadiel points out that at the rate these cases were being handled it would have taken 68 years to bring the doctors before the courts. In the first empirical study of the investigation of medical fraud, Cashman obtained tentative figures on the investigation, prosecution and conviction of doctors. Between November 1, 1978, and Septem ber 30, 1981, there were 646 investigations of doc tors throughout the country. However, only 7 per cent of the number investigated were prosecuted, but a high proportion of these prosecutions (84 per cent) resulted in a conviction. Overservicing figures are not available on a year-by-year basis, although between 1979 and the beginning of 1984, 64 doctors were referred to the Medical Services Commission of Inquiry resulting in $404,949.11 being ordered to be paid back to the Government following the hearing of appeals. However, according to the Department of Health, ""so far, not too much has actually been recovered"". When the amount recovered from doc tors convicted of fraud is considered, Cashman calculates that between 1975-76 and 1982-83, a total of $166,116 was recouped from all doctors prosecuted over that period. More recent figures provided by the Minister for Health show that as at October 1,1983,382 suspect ed provided fraud matters were listed for or under active investigation with the Department of Health; Evidentiary and legal problems deter investigators 53 cases were referred by, the Department to the Australian Federal Police for further investigation; 31 were referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor for institution of proceedings, and 30 fraud matters were before the courts, awaiting hearing or appeal. Between July 1, 1980, and September 30, 1983, there weje 62 prosecutions for medical fraud of fences, 28 of which led to convictions, 24 led to charges being proven but no convictions were re corded and 10 prosecutions were unsuccessful. Cashman reports that, in just over half of all cases where a conviction was obtained, a fine resulted and 30 per cent of convictions led to an order for defendants to pay restitution together with a fine. In short, it is apparent that not only are relatively few doctors prosecuted for fraud, but the acquittal rate is very high and the penalties imposed are light. In comparison with social-security beneficiaries, where approximately 900 cases a year are prosecut ed, only 20 doctors a year are charged, and the acquittal rate for doctors, again in comparison with social security bcncficiaries, is far higher. Even where it is apparent that a doctor is unlaw fully receiving funds, it is difficult to differentiate fraud from overservicing. Excessive services are defined in section 79(IB) of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Act to mean ""professional ser vices ... in respect of which medical benefit has become or may become payable, that are not rea sonably necessary for the adequate medical care of the patient"". However, it is obvious that whether or not a doctor is aware that the service is not reason ably necessary is known only to the doctor. But if such services arc considered by the doctor to be ""not reasonably necessary"", then it is clear that any medical benefits received will have been received fraudulently. Fraud is a great deal more difficult to prove than overservicing, and many investigators decide to refer cases to medical tribunals (which deal with excessive services) rather than to the Federal Police. In fraud cases, there is the problem of ascertain ing and identifying the total number of offences, and the total amount of money obtained by fraud. Documentary proof has to be obtained, patients - most of whom are unwilling to testify against their doctors - have to be willing to act as witnesses, and evidence restricted to services which are the subject of the current proceedings. Because intent has to be proved with each of fence, prosecutors are usually limited to a small number of alleged ofTences. But if the total amount of offences is not large in dollar terms, then the police and federal health authorities can be accused of prosecuting doctors for trivial amounts. These evidentiary and legal problems involved in prosecuting doctors deter even the most committed investigator from pursuing a fraudulent practitio ner. If no support from superiors for problematic investigations is forthcoming, then it is apparent that there will be little motivation for investigating specific cases. It is noticeable that the Public Ac counts Committee was critical of doctors within the federal Department of Health who were responsible for controlling medifraud and overservicing. The committee described the response of senior medical administrators to the problem as ""grossly inadequate ... too little has been done too late ... and ... the senior management structure and per sonnel of the department must be comprehensively reviewed"". It is significant that the director-general and director in Victoria have now been replaced bf non-doctors, and it is possible that other states may follow this precedent. These difficulties become apparent when the length of time taken in investigation and prosecu tion processes is considered. Field reports that the Auditor-General calculated that the average time taken by the department in referring a medical fraud matter to the Australian Federal Police was four months. The average time the Federal Police took to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions was 14 months and, even worse, the average time taken by the DPP to process a matter through the courts was 12 months. At the end of 1983, the Federal Government indicated that serious attempts were being made to combat fraud and overscrvicing by medical practi tioners. The administrative structure of the Depart ment of Health was reorganised, and resources devoted to the control of fraud and overscrvicing were doubled. By the 1984-85 financial year, 206 offices were assigned to the task, at an annual cost of $8.1 million. In addition, a dozen officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions and about 20 Aus tralian Federal Police offices were assigned to work full time on medical-benefits fraud. In line with recommendations of the Public Ac counts Committee, other initiatives were taken which, on the surface at least, appeared to indicate a government commitment to tackling medifraud. the Department of Health, the Crown Solicitor's Office, and the Australian Federal Police estab lished a joint Canberra-based, central coordinating committee. Special training programs for medi fraud investigators were established, provision 'en acted for the inspection of records of private hospitals (including nursing homes) and assurances gained from the Federal Police that extra money budgeted for them would be allocated, in part at least, towards the investigation of mcdical illegali ties. The department set a target number of prose cutions, with a goal of 100 successful prosecutions each year, leading to 80 disqualifications from the medical-benefits program. ? Weaknesses in controls Despite these initiatives, there are still major weaknesses in policies and practices designed 'to control medifraud and overscrvicing. Although since February 1, 1984, a brief descrip tion of the service rendered is required on bulk billing forms, this is usually put in only two to four words - hardly sufficient detail to be understood by the patient. When the patient signs these forms (which include both consultation numbers and the brief description of the service rendered) they may have no idea of what they are signing. There is considerable room still for a practitioner to charge for a higher priced consultation and/or service than the one which actually occurred. The Public Accounts Committee recommended sending a random sample of assignment forms to patients for verification, in line with the practice of some Canadian provinces. No such system has yet been devised for Australia, despite the strong deter rent possibilities inherent in such a practice. Far greater patient accountability is needed, both by demanding that detailed service and consultation descriptions are provided on forms that patients sign, and by using a system of verifying services claimed with samples of patients. Penalties actually imposed for medical fraud, as we have seen, are usually minimal, despite legisla tion which provides for hefty fines and imprison ment. Consideration should be given to providing mandatory sentences in this area so that both, the public and medical practitioners themselves see fraudulent doctors as ""real"" criminals. Finally, despite the verbal commitment made by the Minister for Community Services and Health, Neal Blcwctt, to control fraud and overscrvicing, it is reasonably clear that resources provided by the government are still minimal compared to the mag nitude of the problem. Backlog of cases On the federal level, many more trained investi gators and counsellors are still needed. Medical services committees still require streamlined proce dures and full-time members. As it is, the backlog of cases waiting for referral to a medical-services com mittee of inquiry in NSW is 13 years. Teams of qualified medical practitioners, spe cially trained as investigators, have not as yet been formed, and the emphasis by the Federal Depart ment of Health still seems to be on ""counselling"" doctors rather than investigating them. In addition, the decision in May, 1985 to relocate the medifraud investigators within the Health: In surance Commission, and essentially leave the De partment of Community Services and Health responsible for educating and advising doctors (counselling), is evidence of capitulation in the face of pressure from the organised mcdical profession. The rationale for these changes is essentially that, by placing medical investigators within the Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Health will be able to retain medical contact with the medical profession while transferring the ""bad guys"" role to the HIC. Continued Rage 20. How physicians doctor the books Continued from Pag* 19. HOWEVER, it could be concluded that this approach to the problem of medical fraud and abuse is not conducive to deter mined prosecution of medical fraud and abuse. State governments also have shown a reluc tance to tackle criminal doctors head-on. Au thorities have not yet legislated to provide automatic de registration of those convicted of medical fraud. A political-economy analysis on fraud and overservicing would suggest that, because of the power and dominance of the profession, illegal activities by practitioners would be dealt with less seriously than ""blue-collar"" crime. Although there is considerable evidence of the endemic nature of medical fraud and ov erservicing, the record of prosecutions, con victions and penalties would confirm Gordon's observation that white-collar crime provides a large financial return on invested labour. Though individual practitioners have been prosecuted and convicted for abuses of the health-insurance system it is clear that they are only minor figures on the medifraud stage. There is no doubt that we are a lot more informed about the nature of fraud and abuse by doctors as a result of investigations under taken by the Public Accounts Committee, pri vate researchers and by journalists. What is in doubt, however, is the ability of any govern ment to effectively tackle the problem, given the political and social power of the medical profession. The weakening of Medicare as a result of compromises worked out between NSW sur geons and federal authorities, the failure to implement many of the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and the con tinuing dominance of medical associations in health politics generally suggests that fraud and overservicing will long be with us. The remuneration of private medical practitioners in Australia will, in all probability, continue to be fee-for-service payment. Though there are good grounds to suspect that the rate of fraud and abuse would sharply decline if phys icians and surgeons were paid by salary, this procedure is unlikely to be introduced in the near future. In the meantime the extent to which con trol and regulation of fraud and abuse occurs will depend, to a considerable extent on the resolve of the Federal Government to con front organised medicine. Only time will tell whether such resolve is forthcoming. Paul Wilson is Assistant Director, Research and Statistics Division, Australian Institute ot Criminolo gy.

The Phoenicians and Egyptians preserved their fish by salting it; the Japanese and many other people still do. Salt was so important that battles were fought over valuable deposits. The old Roman soldiers were paid in salt tablets and the word ""soldier"" ori ginated from an old Latin word ""saldare"" which means ""to give salt"". A mythology has grown up around this simple compound and today many people believe that they need plenty of it. They feel deprived when it is withdrawn from their diet. It is true that the body needs some sodium chloride, but an abundance of salt occurs as a natural ingredient of our food, and there is no need to add more from artificial sources. Many Australians consume 10-30 times their daily need. Salt is so widely used in the food industry that excessive consumption is easy. For example, one chccsburger will provide us with four times our daily quota. Unfortunately, the salt habit is in grained in us all from an early age. Babies develop the taste for it because mothers unthinkingly salt their food, children develop the taste for it by eating highly salted snack foods, and some adults are loath to even sample their food before using the salt shaker. In many cases we can be sure that the manufacturer, too, has added salt before the food reaches the table. Much of this salt we do not know about bccausc it is hidden in foods that none of us would think of as sally, such as bread, cereals, dairy products, biscuits and cakes. Why should we reduce the amount of salt wc cat? The major health problem connccted with salt is high blood pres sure or hypertension. The National Heart Foundation found in its risk fac tor prevalence study in 1980 that one adult in five in Australia had high blood pressure. This insidious disorder is often symptom-free until it has done ir reparable damage. When there is high blood pressure the heart has to pump at high pressure; this causes the artery walls to become thicker, harder and less clastic (some times called hardening of the arteries). Eventually heart disease or stroke may occur. Several factors may be involved but much of the blame is now being levelled at the amount of sodium (from salt) in the diet. In communities where no salt is used, there is no high blood pressure. In Japan, where in some regions the salt intake is up to twice as high as in Australia, up to 40 per cent of middle aged adults suffer from high blood pressure. In Australia, and in societies consuming a similar amount of salt, 20 per cent of the adult population has high blood pressure. « ' '? 1 111 '?????"" I It-»«. Contributed by the Coprtol Territory HeoHh Commmiofl There are other problems associated with a high salt diet, including oedema (swelling of body tissues), and extreme symptoms of premenstrual tension. The kidneys constantly assess how much sodium the blood contains and send the excess on its way out in the urine. If they are continually made to work overtime the body may retain too much sodium. This causes water to be re tained as well. Such a situation occurs in many women just before a menstrual period and results in a bloated feeling, irritability and headachcs. These symp toms can be treated by following a low salt diet for 10 days before menstrua tion is expected, but it would be even better to adopt a healthy (unsalted) diet permanently. Medical research continues to high light the need to cut down on the amount of satt we eat. In Canberra the Woden blood pressure trial (1982-82) showed that it was possible for patients on medication for high blood pressure to cut out salt completely and still enjoy their food. About 80 per cent of the patients who did so were able to leave off their medication or reduce the dose. In Canberra during the next 12 months a research team will introduce this approach to a larger group, including people who are interested only in pre venting high blood pressure. Those par ticipating will have their blood pressure monitored over a three-month period, they will receive a free dietary hand book, shopping guide, a regular news letter and a report of the findings of the trial. Applications to participate in the Canberra blood-pressure trial will be accepted over the next nine months, from July 1983. Those interested can ring the Woden Valley Hospital on 810433 and ask for the Canberra blood pressure trial. In the 'Help Yourself to Health' column on July 24, we will look at how to reduce salt consumption and improve the flavour of unsalted food."

METHODS CRITICISED. WING-FORWARD TACTICS Another brilliant New Zealand Rugby Union football combination has arrived in Sydney, and will commence their campaign against No« South Wales on the Sports Ground on Sat- urday. An excellent gnme is expected, as the New South Wales team has undergone a special system of coaching and training. THE VISITORS' PROWESS. Wherever Rugby football is played, the re- markable record of the Now Zcolanders is ad- mired and envied. The deeds achieved are wonderful for a country with so ""small a foot- ball population to draw from, but whatever | might be lacking in numbers is easily mado tip by hard sj'stcmatie training and careful education In tho laws of the great game. New Zealand has yet to defeat the South Africans beforo claiming tho world's championship. The ""Springboks"" are eager to pit their skill against tho ""Ali Blacks,"" ns thoy cannot credit tho almost fanciful stories they have heard concerning the methods «mployed by the New Zcalanders. Such elaborate passing move- ments in the back division, with tue two five eighths arranged to mystify the opposing side In attack, yet maintaining a defence as solid as Table Mountain itself; Avith a wing forward to batter down, If necessary, tho opposing side's attack iß the embryo stages. Tactics such as these, say the Africans, are imprac- ticable. But as they are shortly due to visit Australia and New Zealand, they will undoubt- edly havo many valuable lessons on methods ' and the actual worth of ""phystcal brain-1 work"" brought soundly home to thom. The ""Springboks"" ore a splendidly-developed set of athletes-always In good condition-and can put a back division of exceptional pace, and forwards of tho fast, bustling type, into the playing field. LESSONS TAUGHT BY NEW ZEALAND. From their infancy New ZealanderB are taught the value of finesse, originality, and intelligence In connection with tho gamo, as tv eil as the necessity for sound condition, to ince and enjoy the vigour of the most Btronuous game. Many times on Sydney grounds havo the MaorllanderB demonstrated tlie value of blackboard precision and under standlng, by scoring tries as unexpected as they were thrilling. Australia has, perhaps, - been somowhat easy prey In times gono by for Now Zealand touring teams. Both Queensland and New South AVales Avero slow to take ad- vantage of the lesBouB these defeats should have taught them. But after organising their ¡forces moro scientifically Now South Wales began to Avln games from the ""All Blacks."" Last season an Australian team played a series of matches in the Dominion, and re- turned with a credltablo number of victories, . including ono test match. Tho critics declared that a better Rugby combination had never visited their country previously. The high standard of the speedy Australians' back play was the noteworthy feature of all tho matches played, wbllo ""the forwards showed grand scrummnglng power, admlrablo determination, and vim. Sydney club football may not be quite up to Its UBual strength, but thofo is no denying the ability of the State's representative fifteen, more especially as thoy have been ""housed"" to- gether for some considerable time in prepara I tlon for the forthcoming games against the ""All Blacks."" I SCRUM FORMATION. . Tho ""All Blacks"" claim to have the most «filcicnt scrum formation in their 2-3-2 Bys tcrn. As a heeling machine, It is well-nigh perfect, and is easy to break up quickly, but It Is questionable If tho hookers will be able to obtain possession of the ball from the Welshmen Avith their much practised 3-2-3 scrum. The three front rankers have boen ivpll schooled, and should bo able to get the bali away from their two opponents. New South Wales will also have their two break- aways wise to the ways and wIleB of New Zealand's wing forward game. It seems a pity that New Zoalanders continue to play tho wing-forward in face of the adverse criticism this particular system has received through- out tho world. During the now historic tour through Great Britain in 1905 the ""AU Blacks"" were so vastly superior that It Is regret able they persisted In playing a ""wluger"" when so many British enthusiasts openly ex- pressed disapproval, and several referees went to far as to ponaliso the wing-forward out of usefulness, much to the detriment of the whole team. The only defeat suffered on that phenomenally successful tour was pri- marily duo to the close attention paid by the iretcree to the ""winger."" The New Zealand era would have been a more popular party, and succeeded equally as well, had they dis- pensed entirely with their wing-forward type of game. , AUSTRALIAN VIEW OF WING-FORWARD. la Australia, however, Rugby ia played to Interpret, as near as possible, the meaning el the rulo book; therefore, no objection is taken to tho formation or tactics employed by the Now Zealanders, who also take guid- ance from the wording of the rule book In Great'Britain it is very different. There, conservatism and historical tradition aro In- terwoven with unwritten lawB, and the so called ""spirit of the game"" has a greater influence over what la right and wrong than tho book of rules.

Former Welsh international and Crystal Palace captain Ian Evans has not kickcd a ball since breaking two bones in his right leg in a tackle with George Best, formerly of Fulham, at Palacc's Selhurst Park ground. When one of the breaks failed to. mend there were serious doubts that he would play again but the defender's leg has healed as a result of receiving a constant electrical charge for three months. The treatment has been su pcrvised by Mr John King, sen ior lecturer in orthopaedics at the London Hospital Medical School. Using equipment given by an American medical supplier, Mr King inserted four clcctrodes through the player's skin into the gap between the two sec tions of broken bone. They were connected to a battery in a plaster cast on his leg. The bone hainow knitted, but Mr King docs not know how the cure works and he wants to undertake research.

The Premier, Wayne Goss, said the $7 million program would ensure that devel opments such as. holiday resorts were de signed architecturally to suit the area. Other key points include a 100m buffer zone to protect estuaries, 40m on rivers and 30m on rocky cliffs. Mr Goss said the Coastal Protection Strategy Green Paper did not ban coastal development, and it would not be diffi cult for developers to get ""appropriate development"", but ensured that it would be ""environmentally safe"". Queensland's coastline extended 5200km, offered a variety of dramatic landscapes including reefs, wetlands, beaches and sand dunes, and supported an enormous range of flora and fauna, Mr Goss said.
